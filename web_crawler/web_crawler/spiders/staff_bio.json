In recognition of the excellence of his PhD research, Dr Akhavan was selected as one of UniSA&rsquo;s Enterprising Faces. Prior to his current appointment at the University of Sydney, Dr Akhavan worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research and Fraunhofer Institute of Microtechnology in Germany. Dr Akhavan has introduced innovative new plasma processes to engineer the properties of surfaces that underpin the performance of products for modern biomedical applications such as bio-mimicking implantable devices. His current interdisciplinary research projects investigate the engineering of surfaces for an array of modern applications, ranging from bone-implantable devices to artificial blood vessels and nerve conduits. In surface and interface science, his research focuses on a variety of problems in the areas of thin film deposition, plasma polymerization, ion implantation, surface biofunctionalization, and interface engineering. In recognition of his contributions to materials science and engineering, in 2020 Dr Akhavan received the Most Innovative Engineers Award from Engineers Australia and Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) from the Australian Research Council.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"https://au.linkedin.com/pub/behnam-akhavan/2b/a57/7b6\"><img src=\"https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/img/webpromo/btn_myprofile_160x33.png\" /></a></p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<a href=\"https://au.linkedin.com/pub/behnam-akhavan/2b/a57/7b6\"> </a></div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\" style=\"left: -1000px;

In the academic realm, her research and teaching interests include project and portfolio management and leadership, organisational project management, multi-stakeholder engagement, value creation and decision-making in complex environments across the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. She has been teaching extensively since 2014 in the areas of project management, leadership, stakeholder management, Engineering professional practice, IT ethics, quality planning, business processes and strategy. Upon completing her PhD, Karyne was immediately recruited as a Research Fellow at Western Sydney University where she was involved in a cutting-edge research project exploring CoBots or collaborative robotics in the construction industry. Prior to joining academia, Karyne directed and led multiple client-based research and marketing project portfolios encompassing NPD, brand management, consumer behaviour and market segmentation research for several multi-national corporations and market-research agencies for over 15 years across Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKaryne&rsquo;s research interests are inter-disciplinary, encompassing i) project studies, ii) project management research studies, and iii) higher education research.

In PM research studies, she is looking into various PM research approaches in contemporary times. Her recent research in higher education includes studies in blended-flipped-blended learning (Project Blend) and project-based simulations for large student cohorts (Project Soar).

Such a power plant consists of numerous subsystems - including the boiler, the turbines, the steam cycle and the exhaust system - all of which must work together harmoniously to ensure reliable electricity production.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Similarly, the human body comprises many systems intricately working together, and I believe that the only way to resolve biomedical problems is to understand how the body's systems cooperate together at different scales - from genes to cells to tissues to organs to bodily systems.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"This research has recently led to systematic methods to compute working fluids and materials having targeted properties that maximise the performance of processes, such as heat transfer fluids in heat pipes used in solar collectors; refrigerants in liquefied natural gas (LNG) processes; solvents in carbon capture processes; and membranes with optimal material properties required to carry out the most difficult gas separations, such separating hydrogen from nitrogen, both having similar molecular size and shape.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I am very passionate about knowledge, science and learning, and am always working to foster this passion in students and in the community. My goal is to have my research translate into real technologies and solutions, demonstrating its relevance to society and to solving real problems.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"For example, my research into low-emissions technologies looks at how we can continue to use fossil fuels in more sustainable ways that do less harm to our environment, such as through carbon-capture technologies or the hybridisation of fossil power with renewable energy systems.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My research in biosystems engineering aims at optimising processes for stem cell culturing that lead to therapeutic solutions for people with chronic diseases, such as leukaemia.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My journey at the University of Sydney started as a student in 1997; I completed both my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees here, and have been an academic staff member here since 2007.

{"uid": "ken.chung", "blurb": "<p>\r\n\tIf someone told you that the social connection(s) you have can mean the difference between life and death, project success and failure, or that the location of the social network you are situated in is associated with your work performance, you'd probably be surprised. But Dr Ken Chung's research into human networks - be they social or professional networks, collaboration or awareness networks - shows that network properties at the individual, relationship and network levels are extremely influential on work performance, project success, organisational commitment, coordination, learning, innovation adoption and human behaviour.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"<em>Network models have very real applications and implications.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"In knowledge-intensive work within projects and organisations, networks often explain why a project stops or goes ahead, how work gets done, or how information and knowledge flows or otherwise. Networks are also useful in identifying factions and informal groups, as well as those who hold brokerage roles either as knowledge champions or opinion leaders; these roles are often pivotal for advocating or resisting change. A functional manager in a department may be the leading resistance in her group towards organisational transformation your project strives to achieve. But gaining trust and nurturing the relationship with the deputy manager is sometimes more effective in steering the decision of the functional manager, who confides in her deputy, than confronting and negotiating with the functional manager directly.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"In health care, for example, when a person is diagnosed with cancer, this is generally very distressing news that evokes a strong emotional response. At the same time, they're being given a lot of information regarding available specialists and treatments. In trying to navigate the healthcare system, they can often get lost. Knowing where and who to turn to in order to access and navigate the healthcare system is hugely beneficial here. In turn, referral patterns of doctors and specialists are often a function of the structure of their professional network, which can affect the timeliness of medical intervention for good quality care.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"The networks within which we exist - and how we navigate them - can affect outcomes in a very real way, and my ultimate aim is to disseminate this idea by studying complex social networks of knowledge professionals, policymakers, project managers and so on.

Modelling such networks on a longitudinal basis is important for understanding the properties of social networks and social media use that influences human behaviour in terms of trust, cooperation and the development of sexual agency. The social networks perspective is vital in informing how influence occurs within human and technological networks. as chief investigator for the project, Dr. Chung will be responsible for planning, designing and executing the social network aspects (theory, methodology and analysis) of the study.</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n\tDomestic collaboration</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.ucrh.edu.au/\">University of Sydney</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAssociate Prof. Megan Passey, Deputy Director Research, University Centre for Rural Health North Coast<br />\r\n\tI am currently collaborating with University Centre for Rural Health North Coast and the University of Sydney to understand the integration of health care providers using a stakeholder and social network analysis approach.

{"uid": "hala.zreiqat", "blurb": "<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tMillions of people worldwide suffer bone loss due to injury, infection, disease or abnormal skeletal development, and treatment frequently requires regeneration of new bone. Since each patient has only a limited amount of bone available for grafting, the demand for synthetic bone substitutes is high. Those currently available are far from optimal, but Professor Hala Zreiqat has developed a unique ceramic material that acts as a scaffold on which the body can regenerate new bone, then gradually degrades as it is replaced by natural bone.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The bone substitute my team and I have developed resembles natural bone in terms of architecture, strength and porosity. So it is strong enough to withstand the loads that will be applied to it, and also contains pores that allow blood and nutrients to penetrate it. In this way it is designed to encourage normal bone growth, and to eventually be replaced by natural bone in the body.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The fact that it actually 'kick starts' the process of bone regeneration makes it far superior to other available materials. Our tests also show that it will not be rejected by the body. In addition, we can make as many implants as we want from this material, so availability will not be a problem.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"This material has the potential to positively affect the quality of life of millions of people globally, so we are hoping to see it in use clinically within the next 10 years.</p>\r\n</div>", "bio": "<p>\r\n\tHala Zreiqat AM is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, a 2016-2017 Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard University, a National Health and Medical Research Council Senior Research Fellow, Director of the <a href=\"https://arctcibe.org/\">ARC Training Centre for Innovative BioEngineering</a> and is Head of the <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/institute-of-biomedical-engineering-and-technology/biomechanics-biomaterials-and-tissue-engineering.html\">Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering Research Unit</a> in the <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/engineering\">Faculty of Engineering</a> at the <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/\"> University of Sydney</a>.

Her work in the field of human-centred data mining aims to create novel ways of extracting meaning from the vast quantities of human data captured through various types of digital environments - including online systems, wearable devices and interactive tabletops - to detect patterns in human learning and behaviours that will facilitate meaningful, data-driven decisions in a range of applications. Her work has begun attracting attention from other researchers in a wide range of fields.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Through my research I have developed a number of innovative projects in human-centred data mining, learning analytics, personalised teaching systems and unobtrusive, multimodal capture of learner behaviours.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"This work is now attracting significant interest from colleagues and industry partners both nationally and internationally, particularly in health-related disciplines, for its potential to help us better understand and analyse human behaviour patterns.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"For example, health and exercise researchers increasingly work with accelerometers and similar devices that unobtrusively measure people's activity. Currently, the data captured is far from being exploited to its full potential, as these researchers tend to just extract the kind of high-granularity data they are used to working with, such as total amount of activity per day. I work with them to first understand the kinds of research questions they pursue, and then devise data-mining techniques to reveal new kinds of information, such as the patterns and types of movements people do during the day, and how these evolve over time.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I like to focus on understanding the needs of my colleagues from other disciplines, and on designing data-mining techniques that will transform the way they do their research and open up new ways of using modern technologies that capture data.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"At the core of all my research is the notion of keeping the human in the loop, and of supporting rather than replacing the experts.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I joined the University of Sydney in 2000, fresh from my PhD.

As Associate Dean (Student Life) of the Faculty of Engineering, he also has a strong interest in improving teaching and learning outcomes in engineering.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Structural steel is used as the 'skeleton' that supports buildings and bridges. Columns and beams of steel are held together with connections made from bolts and welds, and we need to ensure that these components and the connections between them do not buckle or break. As technology advances we are increasingly able to make thinner and stronger steel beams, but this can sometime induce new and different types of buckles to develop.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My research considers how new shapes and strengths of steel beams will behave. Will they buckle in the same way as older, thicker beams, or do we need to consider new types of failure that we must avoid?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Some of my work is carried out in our structures laboratory, using hydraulic machines that can place heavy loads onto beams and columns to simulate what they experience in a real building or bridge. I record how they behave under these loads, and then analyse these results on a computer.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My research allows me to use a combination of engineering knowledge, mathematical skills and common sense to find solutions to engineering challenges, but it's my teaching that gets me most excited.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I've taught more than 2000 civil engineering students over the past 20 years, and those students have gone on to design and build hundreds of buildings, bridges, roads and tunnels.

Dr Li Wei is developing new methods of manufacturing these remarkable materials, with the aim of translating the resulting properties into practical applications for a greener future.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My research focuses on developing novel methods of achieving control over the assembly of materials at nanoscale, which can grant such materials exceptional properties for use in a range of energy-related applications.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"One example is the splitting of water molecules to produce hydrogen gas for use as a clean fuel.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The burning of hydrogen can produce large amounts of heat or generate large amounts of electricity. But the industrial electrolysis cells currently used to produce hydrogen use expensive platinum as the catalyst, hindering our access to cheap hydrogen sources.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"So I am looking at how we can produce hydrogen more cheaply, through a process that results in only water as a by-product, eliminating the release of greenhouse gases and other hazardous by-products generated in the burning of fossil fuels.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Within the next few years I'm hoping to develop prototype electrolysis cells to realise the pilot-scale production of cheap hydrogen gas as a clean fuel source.

For example, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most widely used methods for object detection/recognition. This project will use a deep learning approach for predictive, prognostic prediction of patient treatment outcomes of malignant brain tumors. The multi-layer convolution of CNN will be utilized for detection and segmentation of tumors/lesions, and the project will include the investigation on the effective features for training and design of more feasible deep learning scheme for treatment outcomes prediction.</li><li>\r\n\t\tCollaborative Learning of Multimodality Medical Imaging Data &ndash; Comprehensive and possibly complementary information embedded in the multimodality images is of great importance for accurate clinical decision-making. Our project aims to develop collaborative learning algorithms to incorporate important features from multimodality images with prior domain knowledge optimal ultimate solutions to automated subject identification and segmentation.</li><li>\r\n\t\tContent-oriented deformable image registration - Image registration is a fundamental image processing technique, which spatially registers images that may be obtained from multiple sensors, at different times, or at different view angles. Current image registration methods are either based on image intensity information or based on the extracted feature to derive deformation field. These registration schemas may introduce excessive deformation onto the local important regions, in which the local features are expected to be preserved. In our research, we will focus on derive deformation fields according to the image contents for more meaningful and sensible registration. We will use temporal medical images as testing data for our research.</li><li>\r\n\t\tFusion and Analytics of Omics Data - Clinical testing and assessment in adjunction with diverse medical imaging data are the basis for more effective patient treatment and management. However, how to fully utilize of the widely-available omics data including genomics, clinical characteristics, systemic immunity and radiomics is yet to investigate for individualized treatment. This project aims to analyze these multi-stream life data with visual analytics techniques and transform these analyses to our understanding of human health and disease pattern for prognostic medicine.</li></ul>", "associations": null, "awardsHonours": null, "media": null, "others": "<h2>\r\n\tInternational collaboration</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.sd-cancer.cn/\">Shandong Cancer Hospital</a>[China]</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDr Yong Yin, Department of Radiology</p>"},

Without multimedia computing techniques, all this would be impossible.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Creatively, such technology allows us to create content such as computer animations, special effects and 3D movies much more easily and creatively than by traditional approaches.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"One of the aims of my research is to enable computers to 'understand' multimedia data. This will mean, for example, that they will be able to ascertain how people are behaving physically (from action recognition) and emotionally (from facial expression recognition).

{"uid": "branka.vucetic", "blurb": null, "bio": "<p>\r\n\tProfessor Branka Vucetic's work aims to develop theoretical framework and design principles for wireless communication systems. She is an internationally recognised expert in coding theory and its applications in wireless engineering. Professor Vucetic has held various research and academic positions in the UK, Yugoslavia and Australia, and since 1986 she has been with the School of Electrical and Information Engineering at Sydney University, where she is currently Laureate Professor and Director of the Centre of Excellence in Telecommunications.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer research interests include wireless communications, digital communication theory, error control coding and multi-user detection. Prof Vucetic published four books and more than three hundred papers in telecommunications journals and conference proceedings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe is a Fellow to the Australian Academy of Science (AAS), Fellow of Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE), a Chinese Government Friendship Award recipient, an IEEE Fellow and a former Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Communications. In the last several years she has managed several projects related to wireless communications networks development, addressing the issues like interference cancellation, multiple antenna signal processing and coding as well as multiple access technologies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer current research activities are focused on advances in wireless networks and internet of things. With the rapidly growing mobile services, there has been an ever increasing demand for very high wireless transmission data rates up to tens-of-Gigabits/second. The conventional microwave bands below 6 GHz have already been heavily utilized and cannot meet this demand. However, the higher millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band, ranging from 30GHz to 300GHz, offers large bands of unused spectrum and can potentially form the basis for the next revolution in wireless communications. The availability of tens GHz bandwidth in the mmWave band brings the possibility of developing hundreds Gbps data-rate wireless networks. She is working with her team on developing a fundamental theoretical framework and advanced signal processing and network protocols for mmWave systems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the area of internet of things, her focus has been on providing wireless connectivity for mission critical applications, where ultralow latency and ultrahigh reliability are essential. Examples are automated power grids, information exchange between vehicles and supporting cloud infrastructure for detecting safety-critical situations, such as black ice, vehicle accident minimisation and adaptation to road conditions, remotely controlled and self-driven vehicles and remote robot-assisted surgeries. She is developing with her team analytical limits and criteria, and applying them to develop novel wireless communication methods and protocols at multiple layers of communication networks that will meet the stringent technical requirements for ultralow latency and ultrahigh reliability of mission-critical applications. A further issue that she is addressing is developing wireless power transfer systems for delivering energy to communication devices by micro and mmWave radiation. This provides communication nodes practically unlimited battery lives and eliminates the need for power cables and chargers. The focus is on creating sharp radio beams, which will have powers high enough to withstand propagation losses and deliver a considerable power to the communication devices and sensor receivers. The applications will be in large scale deployment of wireless sensor networks and commercial IoT applications, currently limited by short lifetime of batteries powering sensors and communication devices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&#27494;&#20999;&#33922;&#22855;&#25945;&#25480;&#26159;&#20013;&#22269;&#22269;&#22806;&#19987;&#23478;&#21315;&#20154;&#35745;&#21010;&#19987;&#23478;, &#20013;&#31185;&#38498;&#39318;&#25209;&#29305;&#32856;&#22806;&#31821;&#19987;&#23478;&#12290;&#22905;&#26366;&#20110;2014&#24180;&#33635;&#33719;&#20026;&#22312;&#20013;&#22269;&#29616;&#20195;&#21270;&#24314;&#35774;&#20013;&#20316;&#20986;&#31361;&#20986;&#36129;&#29486;&#30340;&#22806;&#22269;&#19987;&#23478;&#32780;&#35774;&#31435;&#30340;&#26368;&#39640;&#33635;&#35465;&#22870;&#39033;&mdash;&mdash;&#20013;&#22269;&#25919;&#24220;&ldquo;&#21451;&#35850;&#22870;&rdquo;&#12290;&#20013;&#22269;&ldquo;&#21451;&#35850;&#22870;&rdquo;&#26159;&#20013;&#22269;&#25919;&#24220;&#25480;&#20104;&#26469;&#21326;&#24037;&#20316;&#22806;&#22269;&#19987;&#23478;&#30340;&#22269;&#23478;&#32423;&#26368;&#39640;&#22870;&#39033;&#12290;&#27599;&#24180;&#19968;&#24230;&#xff0c;&#30001;&#22269;&#23478;&#22806;&#22269;&#19987;&#23478;&#23616;&#36127;&#36131;&#32452;&#32455;&#22312;&#22269;&#24198;&#33410;&#21069;&#22805;&#35780;&#36873;&#12290;&#29992;&#20197;&#24863;&#35874;&#21644;&#34920;&#24432;&#22806;&#22269;&#19987;&#23478;&#22312;&#25105;&#22269;&#31038;&#20250;&#21457;&#23637;&#21644;&#32463;&#27982;&#12289;&#25216;&#26415;&#12289;&#25945;&#32946;&#12289;&#25991;&#21270;&#31561;&#24314;&#35774;&#20107;&#19994;&#20197;&#21450;&#20154;&#25165;&#22521;&#20859;&#20013;&#25152;&#20316;&#20986;&#30340;&#31361;&#20986;&#25104;&#32489;&#21644;&#22857;&#29486;&#31934;&#31070;&#12290;&#27599;&#24180;&#30340;&ldquo;&#21313;&#19968;&rdquo;&#xff0c;&#35813;&#24180;&#24230;&#30340;&#33719;&#22870;&#32773;&#23558;&#24212;&#36992;&#26469;&#21040;&#21271;&#20140;&#xff0c;&#20986;&#24109;&ldquo;&#21451;&#35850;&#22870;&rdquo;&#30340;&#39041;&#22870;&#20202;&#24335;&#xff0c;&#21463;&#21040;&#20013;&#22269;&#20826;&#21644;&#22269;&#23478;&#39046;&#23548;&#20154;&#30340;&#20146;&#20999;&#20250;&#35265;&#xff0c;&#24182;&#21442;&#21152;&#22312;&#20140;&#20030;&#34892;&#30340;&#22269;&#24198;&#27963;&#21160;&#12290;</p>", "keywords": [], "teachingareas": null, "currentProjects": null, "associations": null, "awardsHonours": "<p>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<ul><li>\r\n\t\t2019 -<a href=\"https://blog.csiro.au/great-leadership-in-innovation-and-science/\">CSIRO Eureka Prize for Leadership in Innovation and Science</a></li><li>\r\n\t\t2018 - <a href=\"http://www.chiefscientist.nsw.gov.au/premiersprizes\">NSW Premier&rsquo;s Prize for Excellence in Engineering or Information and Communications Technology</a></li><li>\r\n\t\t2017 - <a href=\"https://www.science.org.au/news-and-events/news-and-media-releases/how-science-nature-and-teachers-inspired-australias-best\">Fellow to the Australian Academy of Science</a> (AAS)</li><li>\r\n\t\t2016 - <a href=\"http://www.arc.gov.au/research-drives-innovation-australias-future\">Georgina Sweet Fellowship - ARC Laureate</a></li><li>\r\n\t\t2015 - <a href=\"http://www.atse.org.au/content/publications/media-releases/2015/women-prominent-among-new-atse-fellows.aspx\">Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering</a></li><li>\r\n\t\t2014 - <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newscategoryid&#61;8&amp;newsstoryid&#61;14134\">Chinese Government Friendship Award</a></li></ul>", "media": "<div>\r\n\t<ul class=\"news\" id=\"inthemedia\"><li style=\"margin: 0px;

Daniele and his group study bio-fluid dynamics with the aim to predict and prevent the insurgence of diseases such as deep vein thrombosis. Additionally, Daniele is interested in understanding the behaviour of cells cultivated on biocompatible soft materials presenting custom stiffness pattern that we fabricated. He is also interested in studying dynamics phenomena developing close to soft interfaces (e.g., liquid-liquid or close to elastic materials) and to understand their implication. To do so he exploits lab-on-a-chip devices with which he is able to precisely control the microenvironment conditions and to design and realize functionalised advanced biocompatible materials.</p>", "bio": "<p>\r\n\tDaniele Vigolo is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biomedical Engineering.

At the same institution, in 2010, he got his Ph.D. in Radiation Science and Technology working on &ldquo;Thermophoresis in complex fluids&rdquo; under the supervision of Prof. Roberto Piazza. He investigated the behaviour of colloidal suspensions in a temperature gradient with optical methods, and in microfluidic devices during his internship at Harvard University in the group of Prof. Howard A. Stone.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2011, he moved to Princeton University working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Complex Fluids Group of Prof. Howard A. Stone. Here he worked on an experimental and theoretical fluid mechanical investigation of particle-wall impacts and air-bubble behaviour at a T-junction. He also developed a microfluidic microbial fuel cell and investigated the dependence of the electric output on the shear stress induced by the flow. In December 2012 he joined the group of Professor Andrew deMello at ETH Z&uuml;rich after been awarded the ETH Postdoctoral Fellowship (Marie Curie Actions).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn July 2015 he joined the School of Chemical Engineering at the University of Birmingham as a Lecturer and in August 2019 he has been promoted to Senior Lecturer.

By designing routing algorithms that can perform this task quickly and efficiently, he aims to help alleviate both information and vehicle traffic congestion without the need to build more roads or add more cables.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The main purpose of the networks I study is to allow either information or traffic to move from one node (location) to another. So we need to find the shortest paths between the various nodes. My research focuses on designing efficient algorithms that can determine which node to direct information or traffic to so it reaches its destination in the shortest possible time.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The problem of finding the fastest route between two locations depends on the state of the network. If there's a lot of communication or traffic over a certain cable or road, additional traffic that intends to use this route will have to wait its turn. This can be solved by adding more cables or building more or wider roads, but that approach is both expensive and impractical. By designing better routing algorithms, I hope to help alleviate these problems without the need to add new cables or roads.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The time it takes to get from one location to another may also vary depending on the time or day of the week. During rush hour it might be better to take a longer route using side roads than to take the shortest route, which might be fine on weekends. Other factors, such as lanes being closed due to an accident or construction work, must also be taken into account by the algorithm.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Results from this kind of research are already being used in, for example, the navigation function of Google Maps, which updates routes when a certain road is congested.

{"uid": "gregor.verbic", "blurb": "<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAccording to Associate Professor Gregor Verbic, solving the sustainable energy supply puzzle holds the key to the prosperity of humankind. As many in the community are aware, our current reliance on fossil fuels needs to be replaced with a renewable alternative - not only because using fossil fuels cause global warming, but also because we are about to run out of cheap fossil fuels. Finding a technically sound and socially acceptable solution is the focus of Associate Professor Verbic's research.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My research aims to find ways of harnessing the untapped potential of distributed energy resources connected at lower voltage levels - including small-scale distributed generation, energy storage systems, electric vehicles and smart appliances - to be used as a system resource, which will make it possible for us to transform our fossil fuel-based electricity supply into a more sustainable one based on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"A good example is energy management in residential buildings. Many Australians have solar panels installed on their roofs, and use mains power as a back-up. With improved energy storage and a home energy management system, they'll be able to reshape their energy consumption pattern to avoid using mains electricity when it's most expensive. Network operators will benefit from the more efficient use of resources and reduced peak demand, and users will have more control over their energy expenditure by being able to use energy more economically.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My work is contributing towards the transformation of our current electricity infrastructure into a 'smart', electronically automated system that delivers services to customers more economically and with improved energy efficiency. My ultimate goal is to enable zero-carbon grids with minimal impact to society.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I've been working in this field since the late 1990s, and joined the University of Sydney in 2010. My main reason for coming here was to find a productive and encouraging academic environment, and this has turned out to be a real boost to my research.\"</p>\r\n</div>", "bio": "<p>\r\n\tGregor Verbic is an Associate Professor in the <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/energy-resources-and-the-environment/centre-for-future-energy-networks.html\">Centre for Future Energy Networks</a> based in the <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/school-of-electrical-and-information-engineering.html\">School of Electrical and Information Engineering</a>. Prior to this, he was an assistant professor in <a href=\"http://lees.fe.uni-lj.si/index.php?option&#61;com_content&amp;view&#61;article&amp;id&#61;91&amp;Itemid&#61;81\">Laboratory of Power Systems</a> at University of Ljubljana, where he is now an adjunct professor and where he received his PhD in electrical engineering. In 2005, he was a NATO-NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href=\"http://power.uwaterloo.ca/\">University of Waterloo, Canada</a> under supervision of Prof Claudio Ca&ntilde;izares. Between 2008 and 2010 he was head of the investment department in Interenergo, Ljubljana, Slovenia. The company invests in renewable energy in the Balkans region, with a particular focus on small hydro.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tGregor's major research contribution is his novel method for voltage instability prediction based on local voltage and current phasors. As opposed to the majority of other methods that treat the system as a whole, Gregor's approach needs only the information that is readily available at every bus in the system equipped with a phasor measurement unit. There are several advantages to this unique approach, most notably computational efficiency and no need for a communication link with the control centre. This research resulted in the <a href=\"http://www.ieee-pes.org/pes-past-award-recipients\">IEEE prize paper award in 2006</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tGregor's research focus later shifted to electricity markets including the pricing of power-reserves for frequency control and transmission service pricing. During his time at University of Waterloo in Canada, Gregor developed novel methods and tools to better represent system uncertainties in auction models used in electricity markets, to study the effect of these uncertainties in pricing and dispatch. His subsequent research looked at developing new methods and tools for stochastic optimisation of multi-energy carrier systems, including intermittent energy sources and hydrogen.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tHis current research is motivated by the evolution of power systems to future grids, dominated by intermittent renewable energy sources. Drawing on his expertise in power-system operation, dynamics and control, electricity markets, applied optimisation and probabilistic analysis, he is aiming to develop tools and methods that will enable a paradigm shift in power system operation, from generation following load to load following generation.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tRecently, Gregor has focused on aggregation and control of distributed energy resources (DERs) at the residential level, including smart appliances and electric vehicles, proposing ways for DERs to be used in balancing the increasingly volatile generation. He is concentrating on scalable control algorithms enabling seamless integration and plug and play functionality. Gregor is also interested in wind power integration, focusing of ancillary services, mostly frequency control, and market implications. He and his students proposed a novel control algorithm that enables participation of wind generation in system support by providing frequency regulation capability. The need for de-loaded operation is significantly reduced by (intelligent) use of the kinetic energy of the rotating masses.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tGregor serves as a reviewer in numerous high ranking journals in the area of power and energy systems.

Associate Professor Marjorie Valix is researching this natural process with a view to mitigating its effects - and harnessing it for more constructive purposes.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Certain micro-organisms can generate destructive acids that attack particular materials and cause damaging and costly corrosion. In Australia alone, our water authorities spend more than $100 million each year tackling this issue.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Developing our understanding of microbially induced corrosion can help us to prevent or slow it, through such means as using protective coatings to hinder its progress.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"But this same destructive process also has great constructive potential, such as in the processing of minerals and the management of waste.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The challenges involved in extracting useful minerals from ores - and, interestingly, also in the management of waste - include the presence of other less valued materials, high processing costs, and environmental considerations. Understanding and harnessing the natural ability of micro-organisms to break down certain materials therefore has huge potential in addressing these issues in a cost-effective and ecologically sensitive manner.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Unlike chemicals, micro-organisms can be 'trained' to tolerate toxic environments and to generate specific enzymes that catalyse degradation of certain materials. Learning how to harness this behaviour is exciting.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I have been working in this field since 1998.

Should we buy fuel today or will it be cheaper tomorrow? Should we invest in this portfolio of shares or will that one deliver a better return? Many industries face similar challenges when making design, planning and scheduling decisions, and this is the focus of Dr William Umboh's research in the field of optimisation under uncertainty.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The problem with making decisions over time is that we don't know the future, so we don't necessarily make the best decisions in advance.

One example would be if we want to build a telecommunications network. Every day we might get new clients who want to be connected to the network, so we need to add more cables and towers to the network. But what's the optimal configuration? If we don't know the location of future new clients, how can we take this into account as we extend the network?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Since we don't know the future, there's a limit to how effectively we can take it into account.

I first fell in love with mathematics because it's a field in which you can say things with certainty. You can come up with a statement and prove it to be true entirely by logic - you don't need to go out and set up experiments to do so. I find that really exciting. I also really enjoy collaborating with the very motivated community of researchers working in this area.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I joined the University of Sydney in 2018.

These plasma-activated surfaces can then form strong bonds with biomolecules such as proteins and DNA.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"One example of an application of this process is the plasma treatment of catheters and cannulas, which are made of a polymer called polyvinyl chloride, to attach a layer of antimicrobial peptides on both the inside and the outside of the tube. The presence of this antimicrobial peptide layer helps to prevent infectious bacterial biofilms forming on the surface of these medical devices, reducing the risk of infection and the discomfort of frequent replacement.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Another example is the use of plasma-based surface-modification techniques to enhance polymer-biomolecule interactions for bioethanol production.

{"uid": "ben.thornber", "blurb": "<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tTurbulence is one of the great unsolved problems of classical physics, a non-linear phenomenon showing extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. It has been resistant to substantial modelling efforts over more than a century. Gaps in our fundamental understanding and modelling of turbulence leads to critical uncertainties in the design of engineering products, the understanding of our oceans and atmosphere and the evolution of astrophysical objects such as stars. It is estimated that more than 25% of the energy used by industry globally is spent either moving fluids or moving objects through fluids. Associate Professor Ben Thornber's research aims to close fundamental gaps in knowledge and predictive capability, with a particular focus on high-speed turbulence.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe resulting understanding can then be used in a diverse range of applications, from reducing drag in road vehicles, calculating lift of aircraft and designing rockets that achieve the required thrust, through to understanding fluid mixing in supernovas.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Turbulence and high-speed flows are of fundamental importance.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Turbulence is everywhere - it's what mixes the milk in when we stir our coffee, makes an aeroplane shudder during flight and causes the fuel in a car engine to burn efficiently.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"And an understanding of high-speed flows is essential to designing cars, planes and rockets, for example.

Currently, using the world's fastest supercomputers, we can only simulate a few centimetres of a civil aircraft wing. At the current rate of increase in computing power we will only be able to simulate a whole wing around the year 2050. So I'm developing software and models to enable us to simulate such things using today's computing power.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"There's real satisfaction in knowing that the algorithms I've developed predict reality accurately - as an engineer, I never get bored with that.

I had the opportunity to enlighten people about sanitation at Button Bar in Surry Hills. What happens when you flush the toilet? It is not something that many of us think about, but we need to. Globally, 2.4 billion people do not have access to safe sanitation. Ever, increasing quantities of human excreta are contaminating our groundwater, rivers and oceans; with severe consequences for human health and the planet. With an engaging audience of over 100 people and a cosy space, we delved into the depths of this complex issue. Through research and teaching in Humanitarian Engineering I am working to find solutions and motivate action.<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/raising-the-bar-sydney/jacqueline-thomas-the-value-of?in&#61;raising-the-bar-sydney/sets/raising-the-bar-2019\">More..</a></p>\r\n\t\t</li><li style=\"margin: 0px;

We're also working with Rio Tinto on establishing an autonomous mine operation in the Pilbara region of Western Australia; we've developed pilotless robotic aircraft that can detect and spray invasive weeds in remote locations; and we're currently working on autonomous devices that will perform many of the manual tasks involved in large-scale agricultural production.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"I'm also developing intelligent software systems for autonomous decision making.

In general, the proposed scheme works for a large number of devices and provide different service requirements suitable for both massive and mission critical IoT. My primary results show that the proposed scheme can support up to 180 packets per second for the delay requirement of 1s, which is almost 13 times bigger than what is currently supported in cellular systems. This is equivalent to support more than 50000 devices per cell using the proposed scheme. The main project aims are Aim 1) deriving the fundamental limits of cellular</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\taccess for massive and critical IoT, Aim 2) designing massive modulation and coding using fountain codes to enable cellular IoT, Aim 3) optimizing the radio resource management to maximize the throughput and provide quality of service guarantee for mission critical IoT, and Aim 4) hardware development of the proposed scheme for massive IoT.</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Short Channel Code Design for Mission-Critical Communications</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>ARC Discovery Project 2019-2021</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis project aims to develop fundamental science to enable transmission and channel coding technologies, which will be essential for building and rolling out of future ultra reliable and low latency wireless networks.

Existing rateless codes have been constructed based on graphs. Short block length will introduce short cycles in the graph, significantly degrading the decoding performance of belief propagation decoders, used for</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.1px;\">decoding graph based rateless codes. In our recent initial investigation, we showed that BCH codes outperform other codes under ML decoding in terms of block error probability in the short block-length region and perform close to the PPV normal approximation bound. However, the existing binary BCH codes are fixed-rate and for a given block-length, there are only a limited number of code rates for BCH codes. Although several methods such as puncturing, shortening or extension can be used to generate codes from a mother code, the generated codes will not be optimal. In this project, we will design a rateless semi-structured channel coding scheme to achieve the analytical bounds.</span></p>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -1000px; top: 38px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\">\r\n\tBy 2020 there will be 25-50 billion embedded devices around the world, seamlessly monitoring their</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -1000px; top: 38px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\">\r\n\tenvironments, processing information and communicating wirelessly with other devices.

I also work in a laboratory, where I conduct physical tests on materials such as rock, metals and composites under high-speed impact.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My research is mainly fundamental. I'm trying to develop our understanding of the physics behind these phenomena. This knowledge will then be able to be used in real-world applications such as desalinating water, improving vehicle safety and controlling rock fragmentation in mining.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I've been working in this field for about 10 years, and joined the University of Sydney about five years ago.

And we can now analyse and predict this behaviour with a great degree of confidence.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I research efficient ways of designing metal structures. These include the steel 'skeletons' of buildings, which need to carry the weight of the building as well as bearing the load of wind, earthquakes and so on. I also work with structures such as scaffolding and steel storage racks used in warehouses. Racks are challenging to design because they're built as lightly as possible but are very heavily loaded, and they can and do collapse for a range of reasons. My research aims to determine the forces leading to these collapses and better design these structures accordingly.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I came to the University of Sydney in the early 1980s as a PhD student and joined the staff straight afterwards, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. There's a lot going on in buckling here, which is pretty exciting for me. My main challenge is finding the time to do it all!\"</p>\r\n</div>", "bio": "<p>\r\n\tProfessor Kim Rasmussen is Deputy Dean and Associate Dean Research for the Faculty of Engineering and Challis Professor of Civil Engineering.

He is a cross-disciplinary researcher with training in diverse disciplines including Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Management, Information Systems and Public Health.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis research interests encompass the interaction of health and technology. With the increasing shift towards collaborative healthcare and the increase in the use of digital technologies, one of Simon&rsquo;s key research agenda is to foster methodological advances in health technology evaluation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne aspect is about developing qualitative and quantitative methods and tools to assess impacts of health technologies in complex organisational settings.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe other aspect is to identify and evaluate factors that affect the successful adoption of health technologies. His ongoing effort in collaboration with clinical colleagues is to validate practical measurement models that could reflect on technological, organisational and process issues for digital health adoption in hospital and community settings.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe is interested in developing practical artificial intelligent tools for medical screening and monitoring. His recent research work includes using machine learning to explore the relationships between blood pressure variability and risk of stroke, new features for dementia screening and classifications of footstep patterns for fall prevention. Simon has also published extensively in the emerging area of complementary and integrative medicine.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSimon was the co-founder of a multi-disciplinary postgraduate program: Master of Health Technology Innovation (MHTI) in collaboration with the Charles Perkins Centre, and served as the director of the program from 2014-2019. He also holds honorary positions with the Sydney Business School and NSW Local Health Districts. He has supervised (and co-supervised) research students from a variety of disciplines including Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy we well as Business.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrior to his academic life, he worked in the Aviation industry for 6 years (between 1992 and 1998) and completed commercial pilot training at the British Aerospace Flying College in Scotland.</p>", "keywords": [], "teachingareas": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://cusp.sydney.edu.au/students/view-unit-page/alpha/HTIN5003\">HTIN5003</a> - Health Technology Evaluation</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://cusp.sydney.edu.au/students/view-unit-page/alpha/ISYS3401\">ISYS3401</a> - Analytical Methods &amp; Information Systems</p>", "currentProjects": null, "associations": null, "awardsHonours": null, "media": "<div>\r\n\t<ul class=\"news\" id=\"inthemedia\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 1.1em 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 0.105em; border-top-style: initial; border-right-style: initial; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: initial; border-top-color: initial; border-right-color: initial; border-bottom-color: rgb(219, 211, 194); border-left-color: initial; border-image: initial; list-style: none none; font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 14.036px; clear: left; position: relative;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<strong><a href=\"https://wun.ac.uk/article/wun-funding-helps-lay-foundation-for-international-cooperation-on-digital-health\">WUN funding helps lay foundation for international cooperation on digital health</a><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0px; margin-left: 0.25em; white-space: nowrap;\">[ 29 November 2019]</span></strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t<div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<em>Worldwide Universities Network</em></div>\r\n\t\t</li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 1.1em 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 0.105em; border-top-style: initial; border-right-style: initial; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: initial; border-top-color: initial; border-right-color: initial; border-bottom-color: rgb(219, 211, 194); border-left-color: initial; border-image: initial; list-style: none none; font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 14.036px; clear: left; position: relative;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<strong><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/health-and-social-services-jobs-set-to-soar-20150818-gj23gx.html\">Health and Social Services Jobs Set to Soar</a><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0px; margin-left: 0.25em; white-space: nowrap;\">[19 August 2015]</span></strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"font-size: 9.6px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em></div>\r\n\t\t</li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 1.1em 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 0.105em; border-top-style: initial; border-right-style: initial; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: initial; border-top-color: initial; border-right-color: initial; border-bottom-color: rgb(219, 211, 194); border-left-color: initial; border-image: initial; list-style: none none; font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 14.036px; clear: left; position: relative;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<strong><a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/08/16/delving-into-hong-kongs-health-data.html\">Delving into Hong Kong&rsquo;s health data</a><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0px; margin-left: 0.25em; white-space: nowrap;\">[16-Aug-16]</span></strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<em>University of Sydney</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tA specialist research group has joined forces to analyse Hong Kong's largely untapped healthcare records<a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/08/16/delving-into-hong-kongs-health-data.html\">More..</a></p>\r\n\t\t</li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 1.1em 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 0.105em; border-top-style: initial; border-right-style: initial; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: initial; border-top-color: initial; border-right-color: initial; border-bottom-color: rgb(219, 211, 194); border-left-color: initial; border-image: initial; list-style: none none; font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 14.036px; clear: left; position: relative;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.chinadailyasia.com/hknews/2015-08/19/content_15306098.html\">TCM research - a collaboration between HK, Sydney</a><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0px; margin-left: 0.25em; white-space: nowrap;\">[19 August 2015]</span></strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<em>China Daily ASIA</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\tHealth information technology experts at the University of Sydney will establish a Joint Big-Data Laboratory for Integrative Medicine with the Hong Kong Institute of Integrative Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

This can result in both benefits and challenges. Professor Mikhail Prokopenko's research aims to leverage the benefits while also addressing the challenges.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Self-organisation is pervasive: individual organisms within a swarm achieve collective coherence out of isolated actions; ecosystems develop spatial structures in order to deal with diminishing resources; and large-scale natural and social systems including bushfires, landslides and disease epidemics feature spontaneous, scale-invariant behaviour.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Sometimes self-organisation strengthens the overall system, increasing its resilience in the face of external disturbances, adaptability to new tasks and scalability with respect to new constraints, but in some regimes it can also manifest itself as a crisis. Examples of such crises include cascading power failures, loss of data in sensor and communication networks, traffic disruptions, epidemic outbreaks and ecosystem collapses.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The general objective of my research is to alleviate these problems by understanding and computational modelling of the critical phenomena intrinsic to self-organisation, and ultimately increase the robustness and resilience of a diverse range of complex systems from digital circuitry to power grids to social networks.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"This will result in increased productivity, lower maintenance costs, less downtime and greater overall safety and reliability, as well as contribute to global health and sustainability by identifying more timely and precise emergency interventions during socio-ecological, socio-economic and technological system crises.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Studying how order is created out of interactions, despite a relentlessly increasing flow of entropy, is one of the most rewarding scientific experiences, and finding ways to guide processes that seemingly spontaneously self-organise, towards desirable outcomes is among the most complex of engineering tasks.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I joined the University of Sydney in 2014, having worked prior with CSIRO for 20 years.

This is evidenced by the many awards and other forms of recognition he has received and the outstanding international reputation he has earned as a leader in both academia and industry.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I specialise in the foundations of tall buildings, which are expensive to build, so my job involves not only making sure the supporting capacity of their foundations makes them safe, but also ensuring their economical feasibility for the owners of the building.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Many of the buildings I've worked on have been overseas. For example, I was involved as a geotechnical peer reviewer in the design of the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Here in Australia I've worked on some high-rise buildings on the Gold Coast, but less so in Sydney, where structures are built on foundations of rock - which is much less interesting from my point of view.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"For many years I held dual roles in academia and industry, and that was probably the most productive time in my career. I supervised a number of research students, which enabled me to take genuine problems from industry and make them the focus of research projects, and then feed the results back into industry practice. I'm proud to say that a number of the practices developed in this way have now become routine in industry.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The University of Sydney has really been the springboard of my career.

However, many PMOs only have a very short life, and are disbanded within a few years of their creation. This research would explore factors that affect the performance and longevity of PMOs using either Beer&rsquo;s Viable Systems Model or cognitive mapping.</li><li>\r\n\t\t<em>Individual characteristics in networks -</em>Understanding projects as networks of social interaction provides a perspective on the complex interpersonal dynamics that sit behind the formal organisational structure. Previous research has investigated how different network structures can impact upon team behaviours, but little research has explored the impact that different individual characteristics have on the network, the performance of a project, or its ability to respond to change. This research would explore how the personalities of individuals affect social network configuration and adaptability in projects.</li><li>\r\n\t\t<em>How Does our View of Time Affect How We Manage Projects? -</em>Project management is a fundamentally time-bound activity. Previous research has uncovered significant differences in how different cultures perceive time. Societies based on monochronic or polychronic perspectives on time exhibit significantly different behaviours with respect to multitasking, punctuality, scheduling, and task orientation. This research will explore how different perspectives of time affect they ways project management is interpreted and applied in practice.</li><li>\r\n\t\t<em>What types of temporary organisations exist? -</em>There is no shortage of ways of categorising projects. However, many of the most influential project categorisation systems simply to reinforce early notions of the field, ignoring the way that project management has spread to new industries and application areas. This research would seek to discover the key differentiating characteristics that define different types of projects. The research would build on prototype theory perspective on categorisation using an indictive research approach, such as the grounded theory method. Using a mixed methods approach, the research could be extended through cluster analysis of a quantitative survey.</li><li>\r\n\t\t<em>Managing Hybrid Projects at the Edge of Chaos -</em>Predictive and agile approaches are approaches to project management at opposite ends of a control spectrum. The former emphasises efficiency, while the latter aims to increase responsiveness. However, actually delivering a project requires both of these qualities, with varying emphases at different times, in response to emergent needs in the project context. Using complexity theory as a theoretical basis, this research will explore the practical strategies used to shift between delivery efficiency and responsiveness to change.</li></ul>", "currentProjects": null, "associations": "<ul><li>\r\n\t\tEditorial Board of the International Journal of Project Management</li><li>\r\n\t\tMember of the Board and Representative of Australia to the European Academy of Management, 2018 -</li><li>\r\n\t\tConvenor of the innaugural Asia-Pacific Project Studies Conference 2020</li><li>\r\n\t\tConvenor of the Project Management Stream of the 2015 APROS/EGOS Conference</li><li>\r\n\t\tMember of the Project Management Institute, 2012-</li><li>\r\n\t\tHonorary Associate, Australian Institute of Project Management, 2003-4</li></ul>", "awardsHonours": "<ul><li>\r\n\t\tAwarded the International Journal of Project Management Certificate of Excellence in Reviewing 2013</li><li>\r\n\t\tHighly commended in the 2013 UTS Faculty of Design, Architecture and Building Teaching and Learning Awards</li><li>\r\n\t\tRecipient of the 2015 Global Conference on Research and Finance (Las Vegas) Outstanding Research Award for two papers presented at the conference</li><li>\r\n\t\tWinner, International Student Research Award, 2005, PM Days Conference, Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration</li><li>\r\n\t\tWinner, National Student Research Award, 2003, Australian Institute for Project Management</li><li>\r\n\t\tWinner, New South Wales Student Research Award, 2003, Australian Institute for Project Management</li></ul>", "media": "<p>\r\n\t<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"525\" src=\"https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source&#61;1nmN1sciMiAhi9_C037o5zBHBTNC-FQ24BGc3FMOsV94&amp;font&#61;Default&amp;lang&#61;en&amp;initial_zoom&#61;2&amp;height&#61;525\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>", "others": "<h2>\r\n\tOther Publications</h2>\r\n<h4>\r\n\tBooks</h4>\r\n<ul><li>\r\n\t\tRemington, K. &amp; Pollack J.

If you think about the shallower, near-shore regions of a lake or reservoir, the sun shines on those parts and they get warmer relative to the deeper, interior parts. That's important, because most pollutants and other materials enter water bodies from the shore, and through fluid mechanics are then transported to the interior and affect overall water quality. In urban areas especially, there's a lot of run-off of fertilisers, sediment and stormwater, so if you're interested in water quality you need to know about the mechanisms that transfer these substances throughout the body of water and affect its overall quality.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"One of the reasons I'm passionate about this area is that fluid mechanics can be approached in several different ways - through theoretical or numerical work, fieldwork or experimental work - so it can be highly mathematical but also very practical.

They should have the correct combination of physical, chemical and biological properties to restore the structure and function of the damaged tissue, and consequently restore and enhance the person's quality of life. In order to achieve this we need to understand how the body's natural cells will interact with the material, how the material will behave under loading, whether the material will leach out anything toxic inside the body, and whether the body's natural cells are able to ultimately break down the material and replace it with real tissue.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Biomaterials is an exciting field of research. There are still a lot of scientific questions to be answered, as well as an endless combination of engineered materials yet to be explored for biomedical purposes. We can use specifically engineered metals, ceramics, plastics, gels or even a combination of these to achieve our desired properties.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My particular focus is on developing biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissues, including bone, muscle, tendons and ligaments, all of which have significant roles in the locomotion and physical functioning of the human body.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My goals is for the synthetic biomaterials that I develop to be used widely in clinics and hospitals around the world to help treat people with musculoskeletal diseases and conditions, and ultimately remove the reliance on grafts of human tissue as a treatment method.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I've been working in this field since 2012, when I joined the University of Sydney to work on novel bioactive ceramics.

Wireless communication networks are indispensable in increasing the flexibility, scalability, and correct functioning of CPSs. Meanwhile, such a wireless communication setting escalates the vulnerability of CPSs to malicious attacks on both the cyber and physical infrastructure. Besides, the data transmitted through some digital network medium may typically experience some network-induced imperfections such as unavoidable communication delays which may deteriorate the stability performance of CPSs. Doctor Mousavinejad's research addresses these issues through designing and developing a secure, fast, and reliable control protocol in CPSs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Nowadays, we are living in the world that heavily relies on the Internet, embedded control systems, and wireless communication technologies.

The same phenomenon occurs in landslides, avalanches and the processing of pharmaceutical powders, among other things. It is this behaviour - along with its more serious implications - that Dr Benjy Marks researches.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The more we understand about landslides, the more questions we have. We now know that we can't describe a landslide as being made up of a uniform material, because it very quickly segregates, so we need to understand the properties of all of the constituents that make up the landslide, and how they interact. The same thing applies when we make pharmaceutical tablets - the active ingredient, which is usually very small, can easily separate from the rest of the powders, so if we treated all this material the same way we would end up with tablets of varying concentration.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I develop a suite of mathematical and numerical models of landslides, avalanches and other granular media, such as pharmaceutical powders, so we can make sense of what's going on. Then we can make predictions about what will happen in the real world.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Granular materials are one of the most common materials we deal with, yet strangely we know very little about them. They exhibit such rich behaviours that describing them comprehensively is no mean feat.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My research focuses on granular materials where the constituent grains are of different sizes - such as landslides with boulders in them. Lots of interesting things happen in these cases: crushing, mixing, segregation, melting, agglomeration and so on. Describing all of these things in one coherent framework is my current goal.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"This will then assist us to design structures that can protect people against landslides and avalanches, for example.

The work of Professor David Lowe, a world-leading researcher into the design and use of remote laboratories, offers an innovative solution whereby many schools can share access to a small number of remote laboratories, providing students with highly engaging science experiences well beyond those that could feasibly be offered by any single school.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Historically, in order to control or use any physical system, we all had to be located in the same place as that system. But high-speed networks are increasingly allowing us to monitor and access systems without being physically near them. My research involves exploring these interactions, and finding ways to best take advantage of the opportunities created.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"A good example is the use of laboratories in education. Rather than having science equipment in each school, which is used only for short periods by science classes and otherwise sits idle for most of the year, remote access allows this equipment to be used across many schools.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"It also means that the equipment becomes accessible 24/7, allowing students the flexibility to carry out experiments in their own time as well as repeating experiments for better understanding and outcomes.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Possibly most significantly, remote laboratories provide opportunities for access to truly innovative experimental environments.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I have been working in engineering research and education for around 20 years, and researching remote laboratories for the past 10.

Classic examples are the emergence of consciousness from billions of interactions between neurons, or shock-wave traffic jams emerging from the interaction of many cars.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"In particular, I'm interested how information is processed in these complex systems. This is because the interactions between entities in these systems can be characterised in a generic way -- information-theoretically -- as information transfer. Our work provides 'information sunglasses' that reveal spatiotemporal information flows, showing us how collective decisions are made in a that can be applied across many fields - from brain imaging analysis to financial market interactions, and beyond. In a neuroscience setting for example, we can map the neural information networks that underpin cognitive tasks, as well as revealing locations of information processing deficiencies associated with brain disorders.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"At the moment, I'm particularly interested in how the structure of a complex network -- the topology of how the entities are connected to one-another -- effects how that network is able to process information.

They will generate a 1000-fold increase in total mobile traffic, causing both a spectrum shortage and clogged cellular networks. This global spectrum crisis has motivated the exploration of the underused millimetre wave (mm-wave) frequency spectrum from 30G&ndash;300GHz for future broadband cellular communication networks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThrough the building of prototypes, this project aims to develop and demonstrate novel technologies for future multi-gigabit cellular mobile networks in the mm-wave band. To achieve this, we are developing the fundamental theoretical framework and advanced signal processing for future mm-wave cellular mobile networks, before demonstrating the developed technologies by constructing the system prototypes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>&bull; Machine Learning for future wireless networks</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis project aims to apply machine learning techniques to develop a novel spectrum sharing and management paradigm for future wireless networks, to address the spectrum scarcity intensified by the emerging IoT applications. We are developing new methods to enable the future radio to intelligently decide when, where and how to use the spectrum resources. We will tackle the challenges by developing and validating new theories and methods, drawing upon the advances in the domains of artificial intelligence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>&bull; 5G Ultra-high reliability and ultra-low-latency for wireless communications</strong><br />\r\n\tThere is general consensus that the future of many industrial controlled, traffic safety, medical, and internet services depends on wireless connectivity with guaranteed reliability of 10-7packet loss probability and latencies of one millisecond or less. Our research will develop new theories and practical methods for design of wireless communication systems for future generations of internet services.<br />\r\n\tWe will create new designs of ultralow-latency and ultrahigh-reliability wireless systems. It will unite two currently disparate theories of wireless systems and control, which will be essential for creating emerging applications of automated power grids, industrial control, vehicular networks, healthcare and augmented reality. The outcomes will be translated to industry and are likely to have a profound impact on future wireless systems and grids.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>&bull; Non-orthogonal multiple access for future wireless communication systems</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe are deriving the fundamental limits of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for massive machine type communications, and propose practical NOMA approaches which can support diverse quality of service requirements. This includes designing novel grant-free access schemes and resource allocation strategies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>&bull;Short-block length code design for ultra-low latency communications</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur research concerns designs short block-length codes for critical IoT applications and services. This includes deriving the fundamental limits and proposing practical frameworks for designing highly efficient short-block length codes using both graph-based codes and algebraic codes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>&bull; Physical-layer security for future wireless communication networks</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis project will investigate new secure wireless communication protocols for future 5G communications networks. This includes novel approaches for physical-layer security in ultra-dense low-latency heterogeneous networks consisting of large-scale multiple antennas, cooperative relays, drone small cells, and mesh networks. The research will draw upon a range of theoretical tools from diverse areas, including communications theory, signal processing, information theory and game theory.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>&bull; 3D beamforming design for wireless cellular networks</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWireless operators are facing an unprecedented increase in a new cellular traffic demand, predicted to expand 1000 times by 2020. These new demands could lead to a spectrum outage, motivating multiple network operators to share their current spectrum with each other in each base station (BS), equipped with multiple antennas. In this case the network operators will function as virtual operators (VOs), operating in the same spectrum within a single BS. As a consequence, there is the risk of interference in uplink transmissions by users from different VOs.<br />\r\n\tOur hypothesis is that steering the receive beamforming in vertical and horizontal directions for each VO in the BS in different directions in a way they are not interfering with each other can effectively cancel this interference. In this case, spectrum efficiency can be increased for all VOs and the quality of service for each user from VOs can be guaranteed as well.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>&bull; Millimetre wave power transfer in future wireless sensor networks</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis project aims to develop advanced beamforming techniques with mm-wave signals for efficient wireless power transfer, while ensuring safety of humans and animals. We will derive mm-wave channel analysis tools and design beam-forming and dynamic power allocation techniques for creating sharp mm-wave beams, which will have powers high enough to withstand propagation losses and deliver a considerable power to the communication devices and sensor receivers.<br />\r\n\tWe will develop mechanisms and protocols to ensure the safety of humans and animals within the transmission range of mm-wave power transfer networks, by devising obstacle and life detection algorithms and transmitting signals over line-of-sight paths only. We will build a test-bed of a wireless sensor network with wireless power transfer based on the novel methods developed in this project.</p>", "associations": "<ul><li>\r\n\t\t<em>Fellow, IEEE </em>for contributions to cooperative communications technologie</li><li>\r\n\t\tPeer Reviewer, European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant</li><li>\r\n\t\tSpecialty Chief Editor, Signal Processing for Communications, Frontiers Signal Processing</li><li>\r\n\t\tAssessor, Australia Research Council</li><li>\r\n\t\tEditor, IEEE Transactions on Communications, since 2015;</li><li>\r\n\t\tAssociate Editor, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, since 2016;</li><li>\r\n\t\tGuest Editor, IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC), Special issue on Millimeter Wave Communications for Future Mobile Networks, 2016;</li><li>\r\n\t\tLead Guest Editor, IEEE IoT Journal, Special Issue on Advanced Communications, Control and Computing for Industrial Internet of Things, April 2021.</li><li>\r\n\t\tGuest Editor, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Special Session on AI Empowered Communication and Computing Systems for Industrial Internet of Things, May 2020;</li><li>\r\n\t\tGuest Editor, IEEE Communications Magazine, Special issue on Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Wireless Communications, 2018;</li><li>\r\n\t\tGuest Editor, IEEE Access, Special Issue on Communication, Control and Computation in Heterogeneous Vehicular Network, 2016;</li><li>\r\n\t\tGuest Editor, IEEE Access, Special Issue on New Waveform Design and Air-Interface for Future Heterogeneous Network towards 5G, 2017;</li><li>\r\n\t\tExecutive Editor, European Transactions on Telecommunications;</li><li>\r\n\t\tGuest Editor, &ldquo;Advanced self-organizing technologies over distributed wireless networks,&rdquo; EUSASIP International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks, 2013;</li><li>\r\n\t\tGuest Editor, &ldquo;Mobility of systems, users, data and computing,&rdquo; Mobile Networks and Applications, 2013;</li><li>\r\n\t\tLeading Editor, EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, Special Issue on &ldquo;Advances in Error Control Techniques&rdquo;, 2007;</li><li>\r\n\t\tAssociate Editor, EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2006 &ndash; 2008;</li><li>\r\n\t\tEditor, Journal of Networks, Since 2006;</li><li>\r\n\t\tCo-founder &amp; Vice Chair, STC on Internet of Everything, IEEE Computer Society;</li><li>\r\n\t\tCo-chair, Communication Theory Symposium, IEEE ICC 2018, Kansas, US;</li><li>\r\n\t\tCo-chair, Wireless networking symposium, WSCP 2018, Hangzhou, China;</li><li>\r\n\t\tCo-chair, IEEE Workshop on &ldquo;Wireless Energy Harvesting Communication Networks;</li><li>\r\n\t\tLead Track chair, IEEE VTC 2017, Multiple Antenna Systems Track;</li><li>\r\n\t\tTPC co-chair, International Conference on 5G for Future Wireless Networks (5GWN) 2016, IEEE Globecom 2017, Singapore;</li><li>\r\n\t\tLead Symposium Chair, International conference on Recent Advances in Signal Processing, Telecommunications and Computing (SigTelCom 2017) Vietnam, Jan 2017;</li><li>\r\n\t\tGeneral co-chair, IEEE Globecom 2016 Workshop on Wireless Energy Harvesting Communication Networks;</li><li>\r\n\t\tGeneral co-chair, EUSIPCO 2016 special session on Wireless Energy Harvesting;</li><li>\r\n\t\tWorkshop co-chair, Smart Grid Communications 2016, Sydney Australia 2016;</li><li>\r\n\t\tLead Chair of General Symposium, SigTelCom 2017;</li><li>\r\n\t\tTPC co-chair, Smart grid for smart city (SGSC 2015), Toronto Canada 2015;</li><li>\r\n\t\tSymposium Co-Chair for Information and Coding Theory, Chinacom 2015;</li><li>\r\n\t\tLeading Symposium Co-chair for Information Theory and Coding Track, International Telecommunications Symposium (ITS 2014), Brazil;</li><li>\r\n\t\tLeading Symposium Co-chair for Chinacom 2013, 2014, China;</li><li>\r\n\t\tPublicity Chair, iThings 2013;</li><li>\r\n\t\tLeading symposium Co-Chair for wireless communications, Chinacom 2012</li></ul>", "awardsHonours": "<p>\r\n\t- Fellow of IEEE</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t- IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEEPIMRC)2017 best paper award, Montreal, Canada, Oct. 2017.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t- IEEE Wireless Days Conferences (WD) best paper award, November 2014, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t- IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) best paper award (top 1%) 2014</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t- IEEE Globecom &ldquo;Best of Globecom&rsquo;2014 top 50 papers&rdquo;, shortlisted for Globecom&rsquo;2014 best paper award</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t- Australian ARC Future Fellow, 2012, I am the only successful applicant in the area of communications technology in 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t- Australian ARC Queen Elizabeth II Fellow, 2007, 100% funded by ARC.

They are light, relatively easy and cheap to assemble and maintain, and fully recyclable, making them ideal for developing lightweight, cost-effective, environmentally responsible structures. Dr Mani Khezri's research aims to expand their use even further by enabling them to safely and reliably be combined into strong and flexible built-up sections for use in mid-rise structures.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"There is increasing interest within industry in extending the application of cold-formed steel to mid-rise structures by connecting several single sections to create built-up sections that offer higher axial and bending capacities. However, the current standards offer virtually no guidance for the design of these built-up sections.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"The research I am currently engaged with will provide a deep and comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of these built-up sections - including buckling and post-buckling behaviours - and will facilitate their optimal structural design.

Many of the systems we use every day collect data about us and use that to personalise what they do. For example, if your computer personalises something for you in a certain way, you should be able to work out why it did that.

{"uid": "omid.kavehei", "blurb": "<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tWhile the human brain remains unparalleled in its ability to perform highly sophisticated information processing on extremely limited energy resources, Dr Omid Kavehei's research in the field of nanoelectronics aims to lead to the development of a new breed of tiny intelligent devices to collectively emulate this capability in hardware more closely than ever. Such devices are expected to be able to solve a wide range of issues involving sensory perception.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"A healthy human brain delivers an impressive information processing capability on very limited energy resources. Unlike modern artificial intelligence (AI) models, the brain does not require excessively high amounts of data to achieve an optimum learning point. It can learn 'on the fly' from experience, memory and multisensory data streams, using input from our auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory and tactile senses.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Despite massive improvement in today's AI models and their successful practicality, they are still far from being truly intelligent or closely brain-inspired. They require excessively large training datasets and a form of supervised approach, and they consume a lot of energy.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I believe low-power nanoelectronic devices that mimic operation of biological neurons and synapses could lead to truly intelligent brain-inspired systems that could learn from experience.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Tiny intelligent devices that can run on batteries could revolutionise several industries, from medical devices to the internet of things. For instance, one potential application is epileptic seizures forecasting. Most people who are diagnosed with refractory epilepsy are not responsive to medication. Other than surgery, a possible step forward to improve these people's lives could be the development of an intelligent system that forecasts seizures using brain signals. Such a system must be ultra-low-power, run on batteries and learn from patients' neural activity over time to be truly effective. The system could either warn the patient about the possibility of an upcoming seizure or, as part of a responsive implant, activate neural stimulation to avoid seizures.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I'm passionate about this research and its ever-growing impact on our quality of life. It's an exciting era of increasing demand for autonomous decision making of any kind. This is also a very exciting area of research as it offers unrivalled solutions to problems that are fundamentally bound by strict energy limitations. I was fortunate to be part of impactful national flagship projects like the Australian Bionic Eye. It's fulfilling to be able to give back to the community and improve people's lives.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I've been researching in the field of nano- and microelectronics since 2003, and in this specific field since 2009. I joined the University of Sydney in 2017, where I hope to address many fascinating challenges with the support of the University's outstanding cross-disciplinary research environment and resources.\"</p>\r\n</div>", "bio": "<p>\r\n\tOmid Kavehei is a Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Engineering at The University of Sydney.

My early fascination grew into an intellectual need to explain these phenomena, underpinning my interest in mechanical and biomedical engineering. It was my father&rsquo;s heart attack in the first year of my PhD, where his blood vessels were occluded by clots, that taught me the shear force of blood flow has a critical effect. I was convinced that my research should solve real-world problems. These days I apply my expertise to understand how some specialised proteins in our blood can actually sense force to enable the development of new treatments and preventative measures that will reduce the loss of life.</p>"},

That requires understanding of the atomic origins of friction, high viscosity and rigidity of confined ultra-thin lubricant films and the interplay of surface and lubricant characteristics. This research seeks to find practical ways to reduce friction in boundary lubrication regime by a novel virtual nano-tribometer/ nano-rheometer. Various types of lubricants with nonpolar and functionalised molecules confined by realistic smooth and rough surfaces are studied through direct atomistic simulations. The project is focused on the areas related to lubrication problems in boundary level and their rheological properties, with emphasis on self assembled monolayers (SAM).<br />\r\n\t<a name=\"boundaryconditions\"></a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Boundary Condition and Wall Slip at the Fluid-Solid Interface</b><br />\r\n\tUnderstanding the boundary condition of flow near solid surfaces is very important in many applications such as polymer processing, adhesion and lubrication problems. For computational rheology of viscoelastic flows using constitutive equations applying appropriate boundary conditions is essential to obtain meaningful results. Using molecular dynamics simulations we explore various parameters that affect the flow condition near the surface. Surface energy, roughness characteristics and topography and atomic order as well as molecular architecture, size and interaction energies are among the many parameters that are investigated.<br />\r\n\t<a name=\"characterizingmaterial\"></a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Characterizing Material Properties by Molecular Level Simulations</b><br />\r\n\tUsing molecular dynamics simulations bulk properties of many low molecular weight liquids can now be calculated quantitatively thanks to well tested molecular potential available. An example is the zero shear rate viscosity of various alkanes. The system of interest is usually put under shear over a range of accessible rates by molecular dynamics simulations 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>12 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). The Newtonian plateau then reveals the zero-shear viscosity. Below the results are shown for a linear and a branched alkane.<br />\r\n\t<a name=\"novel3dnanostructures\"></a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Novel 3D Nano-Structures, the Origin of High Rigidity for Ultra-Thin Liquid Films</b><br />\r\n\tThin films of liquid, confined between atomically smooth surfaces, exhibit a transition characterised by an enormous increase in shear viscosity (by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> in some cases) as the film thickness is decreased to somewhere between 6 and 8 molecular layers. This rheological transition has been observed for lubricating liquids as diverse as linear alkanes and near spherical cyclohexane and siloxanes, a ubiquity that strongly suggests a general underlying cause. Despite extensive study over the last 15 years, fundamental questions remain unresolved concerning both the phenomenon itself (i.e. whether the transition is continuous or discontinuous, a consequence of surface contaminants or an intrinsic property of the surface) and the physical process responsible. We have shown that the transition to rigidity in a realistic simulation of a dodecane film between mica surfaces is the result of the formation of crystalline bridges across the film. This transition leads to a novel solid state in which the crystal bridges organise themselves into a mosaic structure, translationally disordered, but with a long range tetratic orientational order. The dynamic heterogeneity associated with the in-plane organisation of these crystal bridges accounts for the striking difference in how the shear viscosity and the diffusion constant vary with film thickness and temperature.<br />\r\n\t<a name=\"lowfrictionstates\"></a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Low Friction States of Films Only A Few Nanometer Thick</b><br />\r\n\tThe effective viscosity of confined lubricant films less than 6-7 molecular layers is usually enhanced by many orders of magnitude. For dodecane the high friction film has a strong in-plane order with &quot;mosaic-like&quot; structures that extend across the film and effectively form &quot;crystalline bridges&quot; resulting in high friction. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified three routes to lower the friction. We show that the structure of confined films and their response to shearing are affected by atomic in-plane order and smoothness of the confining surfaces, the relative orientation of two crystalline surfaces and the direction of shear. We show a small increase in surface roughness in going from crystalline to amorphous surfaces can lead to a much lower friction. We demonstrate that misaligning (twisting) one surface with respect to the other by 45x results in a much lower effective viscosity. Application of shear for extended times induces alignment of lubricant molecules into a nematic-like order with ultra-low effective viscosity. The magnitude of reduction in the friction and the physical process through which it happens varies for each of these three routes. Depending on the method used, destruction of crystalline bridges, multilayer or fault plane slip provides a route for dramatic reduction in friction.<br />\r\n\t<a name=\"nanochannels\"></a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Nano-Rheology and Complex Flow Through Nano-Channels</b><br />\r\n\tGenerally in MD simulation the averages are obtained for the entire space of the simulation box. However, in situations that involve non-isotropy and inhomogeneity, or when we are interested in the properties of the fluid on a certain point of space one needs to calculate the time average properties locally. For this purpose the volume of the simulation box is divided into a number of cells. To get good statistics each cell should be occupied by a few tens of particles. The properties that vary only in two dimensions are often calculated easily. This then involves dividing the simulation box in two dimensions into a number of sampling cells.All the local properties such as the stress tensor, velocity and density can be measured by this technique. Meshing in three dimensions has been attempted, but it requires much larger systems to acquire good statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe have used to study complex flows through nano-channels. Two examples are the shown here Flow over a nano-cylinder in a nano rectangular box. The fluid is made of dodecane molecules. The calculated stream-lines and velocity field are shown.<br />\r\n\t<a name=\"linkingmaterialproperties\"></a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Linking Material Properties and Molecular Architecture en route to Design of Customized Purpose Materials</b><br />\r\n\tThe shape of molecules in liquids (polymers, lubricants etc) dictates their dynamical behaviour and mechanical properties. Understanding these structural effects is crucial in synthesising new materials with desired properties. In most cases especially for the high molecular weight molecules, it is still very difficult to determine the structure of by experiments. Experimental techniques such as NMR are useful in determining the number of branches for polymers. However in measuring the length of branches NMR cannot differentiate branches that have more than 6 to 10 atoms. Using highly active catalysts we can control short and long chain branching. This produces polymers with different rheological properties. A molecular simulation such as the Monte-Carlo method or molecular dynamics (MD) is an alternative approach to understand the structure-property relationships. The advantage of these methods is that highly detailed architectures can be simulated with controlled molecular weight and shape of the molecules. This is especially useful to study moderate length molecules usually a limited number of molecules are examined in the simulation because of the large number of calculations required. Also, for larger molecules the relaxation time is much longer and beyond the available simulation time. So the molecular weight of the simulated molecules is usually below the entanglement molecular weight. Although the molecules in these simulations are short, they can still capture much of the behaviour of real polymer melts. These model molecules often reproduce non-linear behaviour and normal stress differences that are observed for polymer melts. MD simulations have shown that liquids that often appear Newtonian in experiments at low shear rates, show non-Newtonian behaviour if they are sheared at large enough shear rates, such as occur in MD simulations. Shear thinning is now thought to be a universal phenomenon at high enough shear rates. For molecules with long relaxation times shear thinning occurs at low shear rates, but for Newtonian fluids with very low relaxation times it happens at much larger shear rates. MD simulation can examine the properties of the fluid at very much higher shear rates than those possible to achieve in the laboratory. There are situations such as hard-disk lubrication and flow in nano-channels where the fluid experiences extremely high shear rates. So these simulations can also be used to capture the effect of molecular shape on the rheological behaviour in such applications. An understanding of such structural effects no doubt can add to our knowledge and gives help in devising theoretical models for longer polymers.<br />\r\n\t<a name=\"usingmolecularsimulations\"></a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Using Molecular Simulations to Study Crystallization of Polymers</b><br />\r\n\tWe have studied the crystallization of alkanes using molecular dynamics simulation. Moderate system sizes have been simulated ranging from chains of C20 to C60. Model PE molecules are in the simulation box with periodic boundaries in all three directions. The temperature is dropped gradually according to the cooling rate and then the system is monitored.</p>", "associations": "<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAustralian Society of Rheology</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAmerican Chemical Society</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tEditorial Board</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe Scientific World Journal</li>\r\n</ul>", "awardsHonours": null, "media": null, "others": null},

I enjoy this work because I&#39;m interested in complex dynamic networks - how they are modelled, analysed, controlled and planned - so a large electrical power system with its associated energy sources, storage and loads provides me with challenges in all these areas.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&quot;My main focus is on what many people call &#39;smart grids&#39; - power systems with embedded &#39;intelligence&#39;. This work aims to make the energy grid more automated and efficient, which should ultimately filter through to reduce customer power bills.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&quot;I am very motivated by the idea that debates about climate change and the solutions needed can be settled by science and engineering rather than politics.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&quot;I hope to show that a clean energy system really can provide a stable electricity supply at reasonable cost, which should then have an influence on debate and policy towards making it happen.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&quot;I started working on power systems more than 30 years ago, and first joined the University of Sydney in 1994 as Chair of Electrical Engineering.

{"uid": "wibowo.hardjawana", "blurb": "<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe emerging 5G mobile network will need to handle numerous types of traffic, including applications and devices ranging from the internet of things (IoT) to high-demand mobile broadband. These traffic types have elastic requirements with regard to bandwidth, latency and reliability, requiring network operators to regularly program their radio resources according to demand. While the radio access mobile networks of today will be interoperable with any of the above devices due to their conformance with standards, the software and interfaces used to manage radio resources remain proprietary 'black boxes' to everyone except the original equipment manufacturers. This is where Wibowo Hardjawana's research in wireless network softwarisation comes in.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My research aims first to create mobile technology disruption by enabling proprietary software and interfaces to be software programmable by network operators - or, effectively, by anyone. This will then be followed up with development of various theoretical signal processing and radio resource allocation techniques, as well as network architectures that exploit open interfaces and networks to deal with traffic elasticity and to overcome the current limitations of wireless networks.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Within the next three to five years my colleagues and I plan to implement our theoretical research findings as proof-of-concepts to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of fully open and configurable wireless mobile networks.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"This will be beneficial for Australian telecommunications in two ways.

{"uid": "francois.guillard", "blurb": "<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tGranular materials such as sand and snow have the ability to behave both as solids (in sand dunes and snowdrifts) and as fluids (in hourglasses and avalanches). Dr Fran&ccedil;ois Guillard studies the properties and behaviours of granular materials and of brittle porous media, which have implications for industries including construction, mining, agriculture and pharmaceuticals.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Granular materials are present everywhere in nature and in industry, but they exhibit extremely complex and rich behaviours that we don't yet fully understand. For example, no one knows quite how sandcastles hold together, how we can walk on sand or snow, or what happens inside a box of cereal.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My research focuses particularly on the behaviour of granular materials when they are flowing, and how they transition between this behaviour and their solid state.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I'm also studying how brittle porous media - such as rocks and sandstone, snow, volcanic ashes and even bones - behave under load and chemical degradation. I use puffed rice grains as a model material, for example, which can be brittle when dry but become soft and mushy when they stay too long in a liquid such as milk. These principles are of tremendous importance for both natural and artificial brittle porous materials that are compacted under load and soaked in water.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"In addition, I am involved in advancing the technology used to study granular materials. Currently we cannot see the behaviour of the grains below the surface, so I am developing X-ray radiography methods to study in real time and in three dimensions how granular materials flow internally.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"A better understanding of the properties and behaviours of such materials, combined with better experimental investigation techniques, can improve the safety and efficiency of numerous industrial processes, including the construction industry's use of sand, concrete and composite materials; the mining industry's methods of ore extraction and processing; the agricultural industry's storage, transport and processing of cereal grains; and the pharmaceutical industry's bulk handling and delivery of drugs in powdered form.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I've been working in this field since 2010, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2013.

{"uid": "ali.hadigheh", "blurb": "<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tWith reliable infrastructure capable of facilitating economic growth, investment in our built environment is growing every year. Nevertheless, many of our built structures are vulnerable to deterioration, damage and loss of functionality due to natural disasters (fires, floods, earthquakes, cyclones, tsunamis), non-environmental factors (industrial pollution, contamination) and other events (terrorist attacks). Dr Ali Hadigheh's research identifies and addresses these vulnerabilities in order to improve the resilience and sustainability of our built environment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Due to climate change, structures are being affected by increasingly large-scale and devastating natural disasters, costing many lives as well as billions of dollars. In addition, a large number of our existing structures do not satisfy the requirements of contemporary design standards, so during an emergency they may be vulnerable to structural or non-structural damage and thus loss of functionality.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Lack of knowledge of these vulnerabilities makes it difficult to make appropriate emergency management plans, which are necessary in order to be prepared and enable the community to resume functionality as soon as possible after the event. My research helps to achieve this goal by optimising rehabilitation for post-disaster functionality of infrastructure.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I draw on cross-disciplinary themes to implement new and innovative materials and techniques in order to provide safer, more durable and less resource-intensive infrastructure. Specific areas of focus include the maintenance, repair and rehabilitation of existing structures; the structural applications of composite materials (including fibre-reinforced polymer, or FRP); the durability and fracture mechanism of interface in composite structures; experimental/numerical assessment of buildings under dynamic loads; and the development of an integrated framework for assessing the disaster resilience of infrastructure by optimising strengthening techniques.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I have always been captivated by the problem of finding the optimal solution for the restoration of a deteriorated structure. It requires a sound understanding of the existing structure's condition as well as a wide-ranging knowledge of feasible rehabilitation methods.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I have been involved in industrial and research projects on the maintenance and strengthening of infrastructure for more than a decade.

His research spans a broad area of applications, from the fundamental science of optical processes and charge carrier behaviour in semiconductors to the fabrication of printed sensors and bioelectronic devices on the roll to roll scale for Australian industry.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>\"I've been fascinated with organic semiconductors since I first heard about them in 2004. These materials combine the electronic properties of semiconductors with the easily tuneable properties of chemical inks and the soft mechanical properties of organic matter. This unique combination offers several exciting opportunities for a new generation of smarter electronic devices. Imagine a world where we can simply print electroactive devices on demand onto flexible substrates using low cost Australian manufacturing tools.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>\"Not only can these devices do everything the previous generation of semiconductors could do, like creating solar cells to address energy issues, or sensors for enabling industry 4.0, but because they are organic, they are the first electronic materials we've ever had that can seamlessly integrate with the human body. It's a truly exciting world that these organic semiconductors can open up for us. But before we can achieve this vision, we first must understand how these materials work. Or perhaps more importantly, how we can control them! Improving this understanding has been at the heart of my research activities over the past decade.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe research of Dr Griffith is at the nexus between chemistry, physics, and biomedical engineering. This allows him to pursue a passion for working with multidisciplinary teams, using an outstanding array of state-of-the-art equipment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>\"I love working in teams with other scientists and engineers. This allows me to draw inspiration from the world-class mentors I've been lucky enough to work under and the next generation of emerging research leaders that I supervise. It's also proven to be the fastest way to innovate and connect all the dots throughout my career.\"  </em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDr Griffith&rsquo;s latest research interests include two major focuses. Firstly, he is working on applied efforts to translate his printed electronic solutions to Australian industry. Secondly, he is investigating more fundamental research to understand the unique conduction mechanisms in organic semiconductors, which involve both ionic and electronic transport, and how these can be used to communicate with sensory neurons in the human body.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"<em>The ability to transfer fundamental physical stimuli such as pressure, light and chemical reaction products into electrical signals using a low cost printed organic semiconductors has proven to be a major technological breakthrough. This has allowed me to work with several industry partners to deploy the technology in the real world. But I also have a passion for unlocking the full potential of these materials, and I believe that future is moving towards integrating the world of biology with the world of digital electronics. The human body uses sensory neurons, which operate through the exchange of both ions and electrons, to communicate with the brain. The carbon-based organic semiconductors I've been developing over the past decade offer a revolutionary platform that are also uniquely capable of both ion and charge transport. Furthermore, these soft and pliable organic semiconductors are seamlessly biocompatible with the soft carbon-based tissue of the human body.\"</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em><em>\"I joined the University of Sydney in 2020 because of its innovative culture, its leading role in Australian research excellence and the outstanding people and state-of-the-art tools at the Australian Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis.

Anyone working on environmental problems in the 21st century needs to be prepared to cross disciplinary boundaries every now and then, says Professor Abbas El-Zein. His own research, which focuses on environmental geomechanics and environmental risk, draws on the disciplines of computational mathematics, soil science and soil mechanics, material science, human geography and statistical and decision sciences.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Environmental problems in the 21st century are complex, multifaceted and, of course, multi-disciplinary.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"For example, to address problems of groundwater contamination, it&rsquo;s important that we consider how water moves in the subsurface, which involves hydrology and soil mechanics. We also need to look at how chemical substances become dissolved in soil water or filtered by soil grains, which takes us into soil physics, chemistry and thermodynamics. To prevent contamination, we might build an engineering system to prevent contaminants entering the groundwater (hence material science), or we might find that a better solution is to come up with policies that prevent the use of those contaminants in the first place, or that ensure they don't pose a threat to groundwater. This requires some understanding of the social, economic and legal contexts within which technology operates. Without such an understanding, the solutions we come up with might not be quite the right ones.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;Multi-disciplinarity is easier said than done of course. Genuine multi-disciplinary research faces many barriers &ndash; material, intellectual and institutional &ndash; not least of which is the way we are all formed by well-defined disciplines. And for good reason, since disciplinary boundaries and conventions are important for generating incremental knowledge and ensuring scientific rigour. But they can also act as obstacles to better and deeper ways of thinking about problems and prevent, rather than encourage, more sustainable solutions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;It's all quite complex, of course - but, on the bright side, there's not a moment of boredom!

However, currently robotic vision tends to rely on off-the-shelf cameras that are not well suited to this job. Dr Donald Dansereau's research brings together concepts from computational imaging and robotics to develop new kinds of cameras and algorithms that will help robotic devices to see and do, enabling next-generation robotic devices to operate in new domains and with greater robustness and safety.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Robotics is set to revolutionise the way we work and live, affecting transport, security, construction, agriculture and environmental monitoring. But present-day robot perception falls well short of the levels of reliability and safety we need, preventing their widespread deployment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"For example, we will not have fully autonomous cars until they can reliably perceive their environments across all driving conditions, including rain, fog, snow, smoke, dust, and the six orders of magnitude in ambient illumination that lie between night and day. The same principal applies to pilotless aircraft, robotic agricultural devices, autonomous infrastructure and environmental monitoring equipment, and robotic medical devices used inside the human body.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Reliable perception is a critical building block in enabling robotics to play a positive role in how humanity develops. I find this work exciting, because its aim is to ensure that robots will be safe, ubiquitous, capable assistants that represent a massive force multiplier in what humans can achieve in a sustainable future.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I began working in this field in 2002, when I started my master's work on light field imaging. In 2014 I completed my PhD here at the University of Sydney, showing how light field cameras can help robots to see better in low light and underwater. In 2018 I returned here to take up my present role.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"My role at the University of Sydney is allowing me to broaden the scope of my work to consider new, specialised imaging modalities and new design and prototyping technologies.

{"uid": "m.cleary", "blurb": "<p>\r\n\tThe combustion of fossil fuels provides the vast majority of the world's primary energy needs for power generation, heating, process industries and transportation. Industry, and society at large, wants new combustion technologies that are more efficient and that emit fewer toxic pollutants. Associate Professor Matthew Cleary's research addresses these issues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"We live in an era of rapid and sustained industrialisation, particularly in the Asian region. Left unchecked, this can lead to poor urban air quality. At the same time, there are many people around the world who continue to suffer great hardship due to a lack of affordable energy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"My research aims to address these competing issues by improving the efficiency and thus lowering the fuel consumption of combustion engines, and by reducing the emission of toxic pollutants such as nitric oxides and aerosol particulates.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Modern combustion engines, such as those used in cars and aeroplanes, were developed incrementally over many decades, with gradual improvements made along the way. But the demands of the current era are very different from those of the past. So I am developing advanced, accurate and affordable combustion models that allow rapid assessment of new combustor designs that can deliver reliable service with low-pollutant emissions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Another project I'm working on involves novel rotating detonation engine cycles for efficient, low-cost rocket propulsion. We are working with our partners in industry, defence and other universities to develop sustained rotating detonations in very simple cylindrical combustors to produce high thrust with practical hydrocarbon fuels. It is hoped that these advanced propulsion engines will support commercially competitive, sovereign space launch capability in Australia.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"I've been conducting research in this field since 2001. The University of Sydney culture encourages high-quality fundamental research, and provides the opportunity to collaborate with some of the best minds in my own and related fields of research.\"</p>", "bio": null, "keywords": [], "teachingareas": "<p>\r\n\t<strong><u>Current coordination and teaching</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMECH3261 Fluid Mechanics 2</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAMME5101 Energy and Environment</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong><u>Current guest teaching</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tENGG1800 Introduction to Engineering Disciplines</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAERO3261 Propulsion</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong><u>Past coordination and teaching</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAMME2261 Fluid Mechanics 1</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMECH5265 Advanced Combustion</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAMME4111/4112 Honours Thesis</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<h2>\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tPast research students</h2>\r\n\t<table><tbody><tr><th>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tProject title</th><th>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tResearch student</th></tr><tr><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGeneralised multiple mapping conditioning for turbulent combustion simulation</td><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEdison Ge (University of Queensland, 2012)</td></tr><tr><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDevelopments in multiple mapping conditioning for turbulent non-premixed and premixed combustion simulation</td><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBrruntha Sundaram (co-supervisor, University of Queensland, 2015)</td></tr><tr><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMMC-LES OF TURBULENT FLAME SOOT FORMATION PREDICTION USING SECTIONAL METHOD</td><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAmir Majbouri (2017)</td></tr><tr><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSPARSE LAGRANGIAN MMC-LES COMBUSTION MODELLING OF LIQUID SPRAYS</td><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNazmul Khan (2017)</td></tr><tr><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSparse-Lagrangian Multiple Mapping Conditioning Modelling of Turbulent Solid Fuel Combustion</td><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLongfei Zhao (2018)</td></tr><tr><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tModelling of Mixed-mode Combustion using Multiple Mapping Conditioning</td><td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSebastian Galindo-Lopez (co-supervisor, 2018)</td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n</div>", "currentProjects": "<p>\r\n\t<strong><u>mmcFoam</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tmmcFoam is a turbulent combustion code for OpenFOAM. It was originally developed in 2013 as a turbulent non-premixed combustion code by Yipeng Ge and Matthew Cleary. It has since evolved into a collaborative code development and sharing project. Participing institutions are the University of Sydney, University of Queensland, University of Stuttgart, University of New South Wales, Victoria University, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Technology (Kanpur) and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (Braunschweig).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFrom 2013 to 2016 a number of updates were added including options for sparse and dense mixing models, alternative chemical integrators and efficient particle mixing pair selection algorithms. In May 2017 mmcFoam-4.x was released following a major restructure by Sebastian Galindo which has generalised the code expanding its capability beyond non-premixed combustion. At the same time additional code blocks contributed from the University of Sydney and the University of Stuttgart were added for multiphase combustion, premixed and stratified combustion and particle nucleation and growth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tmmcFoam-5.x was released in May 2018 with input from Zhijie Huo and Sebastian Galindo.

Dr Eason Chen's research focuses on developing novel characterisation techniques that will advance our understanding of materials and so enhance their potential applications in areas as diverse as health, manufacturing, construction and environmental sustainability.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"'Materials science is the mother of technology.' This is a quote I learned during my undergraduate study in materials science, and it really left an impression on me. Indeed, there have been so many technological advances emerge due to the progress of material technologies.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"One example is the boost in computing speed that facilitates the mobile devices we now use on day-to-day basis, and which originated from extensive studies in silicon-based materials. Similarly, I believe that every progress we are making now could be a significant game-changer in the future.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"One project I am currently working on involves the characterisation of hydrogen in various materials, which is challenging because not many characterisation tools are sensitive to hydrogen. This work is particularly important to our understanding of hydrogen embrittlement, a phenomenon whereby the presence of hydrogen causes catastrophic failure in many alloys, such as those used in building ultrastrong but lightweight cars for safety as well as fuel efficiency. Susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement also increases with increase in material strength, which currently limits progress in this area.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"This is a very serious issue for any industry in which structures are exposed to hydrogen, and is also a limiting factor in the production, transport, storage and use of hydrogen as a clean fuel.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"Developing novel methods to understand and ultimately combat hydrogen embrittlement is thus an urgent problem, and is one on which my research focuses.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t\"I joined the University of Sydney in 2018 because of the leading role played by its Australian Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis in the development of Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography (CryoAPT), a materials characterisation tool that I use in my work. I am very grateful for the University's generous investment in such research infrastructure.\"</p>\r\n</div>", "bio": null, "keywords": [], "teachingareas": null, "currentProjects": null, "associations": null, "awardsHonours": null, "media": "<ul class=\"news\" id=\"inthemedia\"><li style=\"margin: 0px;

His lab's main research interests include: (1) the development and application of MRI methods to measure the blood delivery to brain tissue (with a technique known as <em>Perfusion MRI</em>), (2) the use of <em>Diffusion MRI</em> methods to map the structural connections in the brain (that is, the brain &lsquo;wiring&rsquo;), and (3) how to use this &lsquo;wiring&rsquo; information to achieve <em>Super-resolution Imaging</em> (that is, creating images at higher resolution than that of the acquired image data).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn particular, Professor Calamante specialise in the development of the two main Perfusion MRI techniques: Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI (DSC-MRI) and Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL). The former is playing a key role in many clinical applications (such as in stroke and tumours), while the latter provides a powerful quantitative tool to characterise how the various brain regions are connected into functional networks. In turn, the technique of Diffusion MRI provides a unique means to reconstruct a representation of the white matter pathways in the brain (the &lsquo;wiring&rsquo; of the brain), and thus to study non-invasively how the various brain regions are structurally connected into networks. Professor Calamante has also developed a super-resolution imaging approach, which provides a means to exploit the &lsquo;wiring&rsquo; information obtained from Diffusion MRI to achieve image resolution not previously possible in the in vivo human brain non-invasively. This method not only can generate images with exquisite image detail, but also provides a new way to combine multi-modal imaging, such as structural and functional connectivity information, thus allowing an overall structural-functional description of the brain and its networks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNovel connectivity methods can become essential tools in neuroscience, and should greatly contribute to further our understanding of brain networks in the healthy brain, and the effects of their disruptions in disease. These methods can provide new diagnostic markers, which are of great importance for understanding how the healthy brain functions, how healthy brain networks are perturbed by disease, and could help explain the effect of treatment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Diffusion MRI methods to study brain structural connectivity </strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tProfessor Calamante&rsquo;s and his colleagues have shown that the technique of Diffusion MRI can be used to obtain an estimate of the macroscopic white matter fibre orientations at each location in the brain, even in the presence of multiple fibre populations, which in turn can be used with a fibre-tracking algorithm to reconstruct a representation of the white matter pathways in the brain. For the case of whole-brain fibre-tracking, several million tracks (also known as streamlines) are generated, thus providing an overall representation of white matter pathways throughout the brain. The advanced analysis methods for Diffusion MRI developed by Prof. Calamante and colleagues have been released as an open access software tool (<a href=\"http://www.mrtrix.org\">MRtrix</a>), which has been widely used internationally.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://sydney.edu.au/content/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/research/apo-images/fernandocalamante/Figure1_516x192.png\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<i>Figure legend: whole-brain fibre-tracking data. (a) Human brain. (b) Mouse brain. The colour-coding indicates the local fibre orientation (red left&ndash;right, green dorsal&ndash;ventral, blue cranial&ndash;caudal).</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Super-resolution MRI methods for the brain connectome </strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tProfessor Calamante and his team have shown that whole-brain diffusion MRI fibre-tracking data can be used to generate images with resolution higher than the resolution of the acquired data (i.e. to achieve &lsquo;super-resolution&rsquo;), with a technique they called super-resolution track-weighted imaging (TWI). This methodology provides a natural means to combine multi-modal imaging and, in particular, structural and functional connectivity information into a single image, and therefore can play a major role in the characterisation of the Brain Connectome (a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://sydney.edu.au/content/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/research/apo-images/fernandocalamante/Figure2_516x295.png\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Novel MRI methods to study dynamic brain connectivity</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterest in the study of brain connectivity is growing, particularly in understanding the the structural/functional relation and how these two distinct forms of connectivity relate to each other. Recent studies demonstrated that dynamic characterizations of functional connectivity provide a more comprehensive description of functional brain networks. However, how these dynamic fluctuations influence the adaptive properties of neural information processing remains an open question that requires the development of new methods. One of the research interests of Calamante&rsquo;s group is in the development of novel ways to investigate dynamic brain connectivity. For example, they recently developed the technique of track-weighted dynamic functional connectivity (TW-dFC), which fuses structural/functional connectivity data into a 4D image, providing a new approach to investigate dynamic connectivity. The structural connectivity information effectively &lsquo;constrains&rsquo; the extremely large number of possible connections in the functional connectivity data (i.e. each voxel&rsquo;s connection to each other), thus providing a way of reducing the problem&rsquo;s dimensionality, while still maintaining key data features.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese methods can not only be used to study brain dynamics, but the connectivity information can also be exploited to perform data-driven parcellation of the brain. For example, Calamante&rsquo;s group has recently demonstrated how the combination of structural connectivity, functional connectivity and dynamic connectivity can be exploited to parcellate the corpus callosum (one of the largest white matters structures in the human brain). This white matter parcellation can be subsequently used, in combination with Diffusion MRI fibre-tracking, to achieve cortical segregation. All these results are obtained in a data-driven way, without having to rely on a prior assumption of how the white matter or cerebral cortex is subdivided.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://sydney.edu.au/content/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/research/apo-images/fernandocalamante/Figure3_516x290.png\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<i>Figure legend: (a) Parcellation of the corpus callosum using TW-dFC and independent component analysis (mid-sagittal region); colours were arbitrarily chosen to aid visual differentiation. The cortical connections for the tracks traversing each of the white matter parcels are shown as a lateral sagittal slice (b) and viewed from above (c).</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Perfusion MRI: novel methods to image cerebral blood flow and brain function </strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMRI provides a powerful non-invasive tool to measure the rate of blood delivery to brain tissue (also known as cerebral perfusion). Cerebral perfusion plays an essential role in tissue viability and function, and it is implicated in many diseases (such as stroke, epilepsy, and tumours). Professor Calamante is among the international leaders in the development of Perfusion MRI methods. He has been involved in the development of novel methods to measure and analyse Perfusion MRI data, with the aim to apply these methods to investigate brain disorders (including stroke, epilepsy and dementia). In particular, his work has had a direct impact on how Perfusion MRI is used for the clinical management of stroke. He has also shown that Perfusion MRI, using the technique known as Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL), can be a powerful tool to study brain functional connectivity and connectomics. Perfusion MRI has been shown to have a number of important advantages compared with more traditional BOLD fMRI methods to functional networks, including quantitation, reduced image distortions and signal drop-out, increased spatial specificity, and increased sensitivity to low task frequency paradigms.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://sydney.edu.au/content/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/research/apo-images/fernandocalamante/Figure4_516x392.png\" /></p>", "bio": "<p>\r\n\tProfessor Fernando Calamante is the Director of <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-imaging.html\">Sydney Imaging</a>, the biomedical imaging Core Research Facility at the University of Sydney.

The 3D morphology of a neuron determines its connectivity, integration of synaptic inputs and cellular firing properties, and also changes dynamically with its activity and the state of the organism. Analyzing the three-dimensional shape of neurons in an unbiased way is critical to understanding how neurons function and developing applications to model neural circuitry. Such analysis can be enabled by reconstructing tree models from microscopic image stacks by manual tracing. However such manual process is tedious and hard to scale. This project aims to develop novel computational approaches for automatic 3D reconstruction of neuron models from noisy microscopic image stacks. Such methods would enable faster and more accurate neuron models to further accumulate the knowledge of single neuron functionality and neural network connectome.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Structural Feature Representation for Image Pattern Classification &amp; Object Recognition</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tImage pattern classification has a wide variety of applications, such as differentiation of disease patterns and detection of interest objects. The classification performance is largely dependent on the descriptiveness and discriminativeness of feature representation. Consequently, how to best model the complex visual features especially the complex structural interactions is crucial. Currently many different ways of image feature extraction have been proposed in the literature, yet their performance is still unsatisfactory and feature extraction remains a hot topic in computer vision. This project aims to study the various techniques of structural feature representation, and to develop new methodologies for various applications in the medical imaging domain.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Multimodal Neuroimaging Computing for Joint Brain Structure and Function Analysis</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMultimodal neuroimaging (MRI, PET, CT, etc.) provides complementary information for studying human brain structures and functions. Multimodal neuroimaging computing enables the visualization and quantitative analysis of the human brain. It has shown great potential in mental health and clinical applications, for example, to understand neurodevelopment and aging, to study neuropathology in a variety of brain diseases, and to provide diagnostic information for early detection of brain disorders. However, there is still a large gap between research on computational neuroscience and applications in clinical practice. The objective of this project is to design and develop novel neuroimaging computing models and methods with a focus on improving our understanding of brain strucuture and function mapping.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Context Modeling for Medical Image Retrieval</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tContent-based medical image retrieval is a valuable mechanism to assist patient diagnosis. Different from text-based search engines, similarity of images is evaluated based on comparison between visual features. Consequently, how to best encode the complex visual features in a comparable mathematic form is crucial. Different from the image retrieval techniques proposed for general imaging, in the medical domain, disease-specific contexts need to be modeled as the retrieval target. This project aims to study the various techniques of visual feature extraction and context modeling in medical imaging, and to develop new methodologies for content-based image retrieval of various medical applications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Learning-based Feature-Centric Visual Content Analysis</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGreat advances in biological tissue labeling and automated microscopic imaging have revolutionized how biologists visualize molecular, sub-cellular, cellular, and super-cellular structures and study their respective functions. How to interpret such image datasets in a quantitative and automatic way has become a major challenge in current computational biology. The essential methods of bioimage informatics involve generation, visualization, analysis and management. This project aims to develop novel machine / deep learning algorithms for content analysis in microscopic images, such as segmentation of cell nuclei, detection of certain cell structures, and tracing of cell changes over time. Such algorithms would be valuable to turn image data into useful biological knowledge. The studies will focus on computer vision methodologies in feature extraction and learning-based modeling.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t* For the latest research project offerings (PhD / MPhil / MIT-18cp / Honours / TSP / SSP), please contact A/Prof (Tom) Weidong Cai.</p>", "associations": null, "awardsHonours": null, "media": "<ul class=\"news\" id=\"inthemedia\"><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 1.1em 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 0.105em; border-top-style: initial; border-right-style: initial; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: initial; border-top-color: initial; border-right-color: initial; border-bottom-color: rgb(219, 211, 194); border-left-color: initial; border-image: initial; list-style: none none; font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 14.036px; clear: left; position: relative;\">\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<strong><a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2018/08/01/ai-improves-medical-imaging-to-benefit-people-with-brain-ailment.html\">AI improves medical imaging to benefit people with brain ailments</a><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0px; margin-left: 0.25em; white-space: nowrap;\">[01-Aug-18]</span></strong></p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<em>UnIversity of Sydney</em></p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tNew smarts for Australia&rsquo;s diagnostic medical imaging sector<a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2018/08/01/ai-improves-medical-imaging-to-benefit-people-with-brain-ailment.html\">More..</a></p>\r\n\t</li><li style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 1.1em 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 0.105em; border-top-style: initial; border-right-style: initial; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: initial; border-top-color: initial; border-right-color: initial; border-bottom-color: rgb(219, 211, 194); border-left-color: initial; border-image: initial; list-style: none none; font-size: 0.8em; line-height: 14.036px; clear: left; position: relative;\">\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<strong><a href=\"http://gereports.com.au/post/06-05-2015/clever-country-code-5-coding-solutions-paying-it-forward\">Bringing brain-cell imaging onto one platform</a><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0px; margin-left: 0.25em; white-space: nowrap;\">[6 May 2015]</span></strong></p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<em>GE Reports</em></p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tAssociate Professor Tom Cai, an expert in multimedia data compression and retrieval, and medical-image process and analysis, is leading the University of Sydney&rsquo;s participation in BigNeuron.<a href=\"http://gereports.com.au/post/06-05-2015/clever-country-code-5-coding-solutions-paying-it-forward\">More..</a></p>\r\n\t</li></ul>", "others": null},

The time and memory constraints associated with these amounts of information present unprecedented challenges, as classical algorithms and statistical techniques are no longer sufficient to analyse the data. Further, new and even more stringent constraints have emerged, such as critical privacy concerns, or the physical limitations of battery- and communication-limited devices. Dr. Cl&eacute;ment Canonne's research focuses on formalising those challenges, and developing sound theoretical foundations to address them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t\"My research lies at the intersection of algorithms, information theory, statistics, and computational learning theory, and asks questions of the following flavour. When trying to perform a specific task on very large datasets, do we need exact answers or are approximate ones good enough?

What if you could recharge it wirelessly while you&rsquo;re there &ndash; by having it scan the cafe for a suitable energy source, such as someone wearing smartshoes that have generated energy through friction as they walked to the cafe and can now make that energy available to charge your watch? Professor Athman Bouguettaya&rsquo;s research aims to make this scenario possible.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;My research lies at the intersections of the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing and service computing. I see it in terms of a triangle, where the IoT is a way of collecting information, the cloud is a way of storing information, and service computing is a way of delivering information. I look at the places where any of these things meet, and then investigate how we can use the service computing paradigm to maximise the value of the IoT and cloud computing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;One example is the concept of energy as a service that can be crowdsourced through the IoT, as illustrated above. Advantages include that it&rsquo;s green, it doesn&rsquo;t require any external energy source, and it&rsquo;s much more efficient and convenient than our current model.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;Another example is leveraging the ubiquity of images and videos published on social media to enable detailed reconstruction and analysis of events such as crimes or accidents. This would be done using the spatiotemporal data automatically uploaded with any image file, to create a rich tapestry of visual and other information &ndash; timing, location, angle, lighting, sightlines, peripheral environment and so on &ndash; about a particular event.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;A third example is developing the use of drones as our primary means of goods delivery. This would increase efficiency and reliability and decrease costs and road congestion, by relying instead on optimal aerial delivery routes to rooftop delivery points across a CBD.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;I believe service computing can have a great impact on our lives, by enabling us to do a whole range of things better, faster and more effectively.

The flipside of this flexibility, however, is that any given software program is unlikely to make use of all the available hardware. Dr David Boland&rsquo;s research focuses on this issue, with the aim of achieving faster and more energy-efficient computing.<br />\r\n\t&ldquo;I study the computer algorithms used to solve problems across many domains, including scientific computing, machine learning and optical communications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;I then consider how to design fully customised hardware solutions to these problems. In doing this I focus on how to perform as little computation as necessary, while still obtaining results as accurate as those produced by the original algorithm used in the software. This helps to maximise energy efficiency. I also look at how to do as much parallel computation as possible, in order to maximise performance.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;The technology to support this exists: we can already create application-specific integrated circuits, and we can use field-programmable gate arrays on which custom hardware designs can be programmed after manufacturing. However, designing customised hardware architectures is challenging, so is currently restricted to experts. I&rsquo;m interested in making this performance more widely accessible.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;My research to date has largely focused on accelerating common computational kernels and basic arithmetic structures. I&rsquo;m currently working on creating custom hardware accelerators for machine learning within the context of analysing wireless communication systems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;The ability to perform fast analysis and prediction using this information could be critical for effective military operations, for example. High-performance and energy-efficient computation is also critical for the development and widespread use of novel technologies such as artificial intelligence, which could transform society. The challenge is to develop design techniques that are of benefit both now and in the future.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working in this field since 2007, and I joined the University of Sydney in 2017.
