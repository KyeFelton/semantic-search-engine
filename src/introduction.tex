% Site search.

% The search experience on the University’s web site leaves much to be desired. In an attempt to solve this problem, this project will develop and test an ontology-driven semantic search engine for the University.

% The following tasks will be completed:
% • Review relevant literature, including previous research on academic search engines
% • Develop and validate an ontology
% • Develop and validate a knowledge graph, utilising the University of Sydney’s data repository along with the ontology developed prior
% • Develop and test a semantic search engine, utilising the knowledge graph developed prior
% • Evaluate the quality and performance of the search engine through experimentation
% • Present the results, findings, lessons learned and conclusion in a thesis report
