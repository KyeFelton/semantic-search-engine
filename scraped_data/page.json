Thermal stratification is common in Australia\u2019s rivers due to our drought-prone climate and high human demands. It inhibits mixing, creating stagnant conditions, characterised by low oxygen levels and increased concentrations of contaminants. It leads to algal blooms, fish kills and systemic damage to ecosystems. Our aim is to develop predictive models to maximise physical processes such as night-time cooling, wind, turbulence and currents on riverine thermal stratification. Our goal is to enable a more accurate determination of the flow rates required to maintain the health of our river systems.\u2028\u2028. We use a combination of high resolution numerical simulations \u2013 direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) \u2013 scaling analysis and stability analysis. Maintaining the health of our river systems involves balancing the needs of agriculture, domestic and commercial users, fisheries, power generators, industry, tourism, recreational users and the environment. We aim to provide the scientific foundations for a new generation of river management tools to allow authorities to better optimise water allocations and river flows to maximise both economic and environmental benefits."

Volcanic eruptions, building air ventilation, smoke stack releases and brine discharge from desalination plants are all examples of fluid flows where differences in density between the fluid release and its surrounding environment can control the flow behavior. These flows can be classified as turbulent fountains, buoyant jets or plumes depending on the specific release conditions. We need the ability to accurately predict entrainment of ambient fluid into the fountain/jet/plume. Our research scrutinises the turbulent structure of fountains and plumes using numerical simulation and laboratory experiments. We work to understand and quantify this entrainment and develop new more sophisticated modeling tools to support the next generation of engineers."

Natural convection flows occur in a wide range of industrial and environmental settings. These range from the cooling of computer components to heat transfer in the earth\u2019s mantle. It acts to enhance the transfer of heat from regions of high to low temperatures. The rate of heat transfer is determined by the state of the flow, whether laminar, transition or fully turbulent. Understanding such flows is critical in the design of heat exchangers, building heating ventilation and cooling systems. It is also crucial in the prediction of many large-scale environmental features such as the occurrence of convective overturns and near-shore transport in lakes and reservoirs. Our research relies on large-scale direct numerical simulation of the governing Navier-Stokes equations, the use of semi-analytic stability techniques, scaling and laboratory experiments. These provide a deeper understanding of the transitional behaviour of the thermal boundary layer and aid the development of predictive tools and strategies for controlling transition and limiting or enhancing heat transfer."

Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) provides a potential pathway towards utilisation of fusion power as an energy source. In ICF, powerful lasers are employed to rapidly compress a small sphere of deuterium/tritium to the required temperature and pressure to produce fusion. Such small spheres could be imploded multiple times per second, with each pulse providing a small release of energy. With even a modest conversion rate, a system could provide enough energy to sustain mankind for many centuries. However, fluid instabilities develop and these can prevent fusion being achieved. Our research aims to understand how the instabilities develop and transition to turbulence. Accordingly, we aim to inform the future design of the fuel capsules, utilising very high-resolution computations undertaken on several thousand computational cores. We explore the fundamentals of compressible turbulent mixing, simplified modelling of mixing problems and new numerical approaches to compute unsteady turbulent mixing problems. This work is in collaboration with multiple institutions worldwide and employs the top supercomputing facilities in Australia to deliver an unprecedented insight into the turbulent physics."

The nature of inhaled drug-laden flows have a dependence on the device that is delivering the drugs, the formulation of the drug itself, as well as the characteristics of the individual (in terms of breathing profile and geometry of the airways). Understanding this complex problem benefits substantially through implementation of fundamental fluid mechanics principles. Research of this nature can lead us to improved methods of drug targeting, drug delivery device design, and improved guidelines for device use. Our research relies both on using existent state-of-the-art experimental techniques and developing new experimental diagnostic methods in order to a) improve our fundamental understanding of the two-phase fluid mechanics of drug delivery systems and b) suggest practical ways to improve the delivery of drugs."

The burner provides a challenging platform for combustion modellers where the requirement is for a single-model to be able to compute all modes of combustion. The project is highly relevant to combustion in direct-injection engines and gas turbines where compositional inhomogeneity and high rates of shear dominate the flow within the combustion chamber. Developing a database for model validation in well-controlled burners is important. This is made possible with the piloted inhomogeneous burner designed and built at the University of Sydney. In the burner, the reacting mixture is introduced through two annular tubes such that the inner tubes can slide upstream of the jet exit plane. Both shear and compositional inhomogeneity can be introduced independently by varying the composition, the velocity ratio and the recess distances of the inner tube with respect to the annulus.

We have pioneered the modelling of turbulence-chemistry interactions through the conditional moment closure method, instrumental in developing the multiple-mapping conditioning approach which aims to provide a unified representation of premixed and non-premixed combustion under a single modelling approach. This has led to the development of sparse-Lagrangian models for turbulent reacting flows which offer high accuracy and very low computational cost. We lead an international collaboration from Australia, Germany, India and China developing the open-source combustion code known as mmcFoam that is being applied to combustion of gaseous, liquid and solid fuels and to the formation of solid nanoparticles. In addition to model development, we\u2019re also advancing the underlying numerical algorithms for mixing and reacting flows, developing new governing equations and solution methods which improve the accuracy of representation of both turbulence and the mixing zone. The methods we\u2019ve developed have been implemented in the open-source CFD algorithm OpenFOAM, and in-house codes, both of which are parallelised and thus can be used to explore the fundamentals of turbulence and reactions through large-scale computations on national high performance computing facilities."

Another objective is to develop a chemically suppressing agent that can be used with water to enhance its fire-fighting capability. The research will study the dynamics of delivering water sprays into a fire and then the water will be mixed with various agents (such a metal salts) to check the possible improvement of fire suppression."

            "About the centre. The Centre for Future Energy Networks (CFEN) was established in the School of Electrical and Information Engineering in 2012. Our mission is to become Australia\u2019s preeminent centre in research and advanced training oriented to an era of constrained-carbon systems. We aim to achieve this by promoting and supporting research sponsored by government and industrial partners in the areas of energy and power networks and key technologies in this field. Our research is now reshaping electricity networks to fit the special conditions and challenges within Australia \u2013 that is, managing abundant energy sources for a relatively small population across large geographical areas. One such example is the National Electricity Market (NEM) transmission path down the east coast of Australia which is the longest in the world. We are also providing our talented students studying this field and industry partners with a deeper understanding of these ongoing obstacles. Our research. We focus on a range of research initiatives orientated to an era of constrained-carbon systems. Our key areas are: Grid operations and planning, Distributed control, Grid integration, You can find our publications in the academic profiles of individual researchers by clicking on their name in each project. Grid operations and planning. The traditional highly-centralised grid structure is being questioned for its long-term suitability. New ideas such as microgrids and smart grids are likely to change grids especially at distribution levels. It must be secure, and interact with associated networks such as water, gas, transport and telecommunication. The centre works on a range of problems related to future energy grids including the impact of renewables, demand response and energy storage, and their impact on grid stability. Our team can provide options for the national grid given scenarios for the energy mix trajectory over decades ahead. Our work focuses on the physical power systems and ensuring secure system operations and promoting efficient system expansion planning in industrial practices. Together with industry partners nationally and internationally, CFEN has extensive experience in areas such as generic constraints for electricity market operations and planning, power system load modeling, power system Var control and prediction, power system forecasting and predictive control, fast simulation techniques for system dynamic analysis, electricity market simulation and system vulnerability and stability assessment techniques. Previous project deliverables have been used by the power industry in Australia, mainland China, Hong Kong and USA.",
            "Distributed control. Work on distributed control was started with our participation in the Australian government\u2019s Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project. This led to the view that smarter grids go beyond providing enhanced data from the grid; there should be more capability to operate and control the whole system in a distributed way with new structures, which would allow new technologies like demand-side control and control using energy storage. To achieve the required performance from any future grid, the control system will need to take account of diverse data; process this data in a timely and distributed manner; optimise across different voltage levels; and send appropriate control instructions for the optimum operation of all system components. The fundamental building blocks for advanced smart grids are well established in our centre research, namely power networks and markets, telecommunications, data mining and learning, constrained optimisation, and distributed control. The research work is exploring demand response mechanisms, scaling solutions, reducing peak demand, enhancing reliability and then enabling new capabilities for future grids, particularly substantially decreasing levels of carbon emissions.",
            "Grid integration. Our grid integration all aim to facilitate the greater penetration of new technologies such as distributed generation, large-scale renewable power, energy storage and electronic vehicles. Many projects involve novel designs for power electronic converters. A theme is how to ensure distributed generation and demand response can also participate in system services. Projects with vendors, including ABB for solar energy management systems, have begun or are being set up. This work informs the modeling needed for the planning and smart grids research."

We assisted the CSIRO in delivering the first analytical framework of its kind to systematically investigate the most economically efficient energy network (electricity and natural gas) configurations for Australia. With this framework, Australia will be able to identify the lowest cost pathway to integrate significant amounts of large and small scale renewables into our grid with existing technologies while maintaining operational stability. This will pave the way for significant emissions reductions in Australia\u2019s most carbon intensive economic sector. Advanced modelling and analytical techniques are now being developed to provide a suite of tools to expand our understanding of: the total costs of transmission and distribution systems for standard and alternative grid topologies, the development and treatment of methods to deal with increasing renewable energy supply of 20% and beyond, potential market failures in current system planning and operations in dealing with intermittent renewable generation, the full benefit of demand side measures in reducing total system cost, i.e. the investment and operating costs of generation, storage, transmission and distribution assets, potential policy and regulatory models that would help Australia implement the most optimal, technologically feasible outcome. We will study scenarios out to 2050 driven by fuel prices, policy, market and grid planning paradigms. Analytical techniques are being developed for grid performance assessment and optimal design in terms of reliability, cost and carbon emission limits."

This proposal addresses the sustainability of electrical power delivery systems. The traditional paradigm of generation following demand, where millions of diverse customer actions are balanced with the controlled output of a small number of major generation plants, cannot handle the distributed and variable nature of solar and wind energy sources. We will study a new paradigm, which is adaptive in the sense of demand following generation. The load devices contribute to overall balancing and welfare of the system in processes of demand response and load control. Thus future smart loads, using advanced power electronics, and the control and communication systems must themselves be adaptive to the dynamically changing power generation and circumstances. The four research teams will be led by internationally renowned experts in the key areas: power systems, power electronics, computer networking and control technology. The investigators will add special skills for particular projects. By integrating these areas in a balanced way, the aim is to build a unique research capability which can support the future industry in the Pearl River Region and beyond. The team will build on several of its own highly innovative ideas that have shown promise for the proposed research, namely (i) electric springs, (ii) granular modelling and control and (iii) adaptive networking (integrated with communication, control and security)."

In our modern digital life, activities from buying clothes to accessing government services depend on working with computer applications which store information in a long-lasting form. That is, they need a data store, where information (called \u201dvalues\u201d) is found using a label or \u201dkey\u201d. So the key-value store is vital for the functionality and performance of all applications. Even relational databases typically contain a key-value store as a storage engine, underneath layers that support a richer query model. The current key-value stores are designed for today\u2019s typical hardware environment with a memory hierarchy of slow but capacious hard disk, flash-based SSD, and fast but limited and volatile RAM. Currently, key-value stores cannot leverage the speed of fast NVMe SSDs and byte-addressable persistent memory. Our research rethinks the way data is stored in memory and on disk to design a fast key-value store for modern drives and persistent memory. We have observed that the overall system performance bottleneck is caused by CPU speed instead of the storage device bandwidth or latency,and proposed a new storage layout and streamlined algorithms to access data on fast NVMe SSDs. Our pioneer work to redesign key-value stores has resulted in several top tier publications in SOSP and OSDI."

Phase-change material (PCM) offers many new potentials, but the limited heat transfer rate remains one of the key challenges that hinders the application of these potentials. The aim of this project is to use highly thermally-conductive materials to enhance the equivalent heat conductivity of a PCM so that the charging and discharging rate can be flexibly regulated in the application process. The outcome of this project will be a new generation of TES materials and designs that will help promote the wider use of solar energy for building and heating applications, greatly cutting the carbon foot printing of building stocks."

Laboratory: Fluids Laboratory, Convection Laboratory. Nutrients, pollutants, biological and other materials are carried into lakes and reservoirs primarily from the shore. These materials are distributed by a range of physical processes, one of which is the motions set up by horizontal temperature gradients resulting from unequal heat capture and losses. These arise because the heat transfers from solar radiation and other heat fluxes at the surface are approximately uniform spatially; however the depth decreases towards the shore. This results in greater volumetric heating (daytime) or cooling (night time) so that the shallow part becomes warmer/cooler than the deeper part. Further, some residual radiation reaches the bed and is remitted as a heat flux (which may give rise to instability) and rising plumes. These complex motions are studied experimentally and with numerical, analytical and stability analyses."

The data is complex, as nodes and edges have multivariate attributes. Exploiting such data sets is hard due to its size and complexity \u2013 using current methods, a normal person cannot even deal with a fraction of the data. More efficient ways to understand the data are needed. We propose to design, implement and evaluate new visualisation methods that scale well with the size of today\u2019s and future (larger) data sets. In common language, a picture is worth a thousand words. We aim to create such pictures for massive multivariate network data sets. Our project will create new methods for the visual analysis of massive multivariate networks such as complex software systems, social networks, and biological systems.

            "Leading the three-year research project is Professor Robyn Dowling, an urban planning researcher in the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Planning, in collaboration with Professor Pauline McGuirk, a human geographer at the University of Wollongong. \"This will be the first major analysis to understand the promise and peril of 'smart city' strategies in Australia,\" said Professor Dowling. \"Smart technologies are changing the way cities operate to enhance quality of life, efficiency and innovation. It is a key strategy that governments in Australia and internationally are adopting to address economic prosperity, urban efficiency, and resource security. \"Yet, we have little understanding of how these strategies are being rolled out in Australia and the potential social, economic and political implications,\" she said. A national audit and detailed on-the-ground case studies across Sydney, Parramatta and Newcastle will underpin the three-year research project. The findings will provide insight into how new technologies are altering the coordination and governance of city life in Australia. The grant recognises the rising importance of cities as sites of innovation and economic growth that is supported by Australia's national innovation agenda and the Federal appointment of the new Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation earlier in the year. Professor Dowling said: \"Our research will provide the evidence for how 'smart cities' will change society and how it is governed. It will also track how governance is being reworked in a technology-mapped society, and by new interests and alliances that are being given the power to run the city through smart capabilities. \"These alliances include 'top-down', city-led strategies, projects led by urban authorities and tech corporations, as well as 'bottom-up' community-led initiatives. \"The knowledge gathered will inform ongoing policy debates that will help shape smart cities, which are hopefully more equitable and fair for all people,\" she said."

            "Antikythera shipwreck skeleton remains. Two years ago the University of Sydney\u2019s Professor Stefan Williams, Dr Oscar Pizarro and Christian Lees from the University\u2019s Australian Centre for Field Robotics surveyed and mapped 10,500 square meters of the sea floor near the island of Antikythera in Greece. They used stereo cameras on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles to gather overlapping images of a shipwreck, and processed these with the aid of a Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping algorithm to create a three-dimensional model of the site. As a result of the mapping work, archaeologists and technical experts from the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) recently made a ground-breaking discovery; a 2000-year-old human skeleton (100BC). This is the first to be recovered from an ancient shipwreck since the introduction of DNA studies. This latest discovery consists of a partial skull with three teeth, two arm bones, several rib pieces and two femurs, likely originating from the same person. The skeleton contains petrous bones\u2014dense nuggets behind the ear which are more likely to preserve DNA than other parts of the body. If there is a sufficient enough amount of DNA extracted, it may be possible to identify the shipwreck victim\u2019s ethnicity, hair and eye colour and their geographic origin.",
            "Antikythera shipwreck skeleton remains. Project co-Director, Dr Brendan Foley said the bathymetric map developed by the University of Sydney\u2019s Australian Centre for Field Robotics team \u201cis the foundation of the Antikythera Shipwreck excavation.\u201d \u201cThis map is quite literally in our diver\u2019s hands, as we use tablet computers in underwater housings to localise every artifact we find during the dives. Our analysis of the artifact distribution on the map led us to excavate in a certain area of the wreck. As a result, that excavation trench delivered the human skeletal remains.\u201d. There have only been a few examples in history of human remains being discovered on ancient wrecks, as they are typically swept away, decay or are eaten by the sea life. What this recent find might tell us about the lives of people who lived in 100BC is significant, particularly as excavation work continues in the hopes of finding more bones; made possible by the University of Sydney\u2019s ground-work."

The Centre for Translational Data Science, launched in October last year, is a multidisciplinary initiative bringing together expertise from across the University to use big data and machine learning to solve real-world problems, such as crime prevention, youth unemployment, and advancing medical treatments. Professor Sally Cripps and Associate Professor Fabio Ramos will work with the Centre\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Alexandra Gibson, to bring to life the nascent strategic plan for the Centre, which includes establishing a governance framework, developing a strategic plan and undertaking key research projects that facilitate discoveries in science, health and beyond. Professor Cripps, from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, whose research expertise lies in Bayesian methodology, said that by the end of 2020, the Centre aims to have built a research group of around 150 staff and PhD students. \"The vision of CTDS is to drive an ambitious new data-driven approach to discovery and modelling of complex phenomena in physical, life and social sciences by forging truly multidisciplinary partnerships between leading domain experts and data scientists,\" Professor Cripps said. Associate Professor Ramos, from the School of Information Technologies, said the Centre is also working closely with faculties and industries to deliver the next generation of machine learning methods to address the most challenging research questions in health, earth sciences, criminology and autonomous systems. \"We are working to unleash the power of data and creating algorithms to make informative decisions under uncertainty,\" the machine learning and data mining expert said. Professor Laurent Rivory, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Strategic Collaborations and Partnerships), who oversees the University\u2019s multidisciplinary initiatives, said it\u2019s an exciting time for data science research and teaching at the University. \"The Centre for Translational Data Science is one of a few research hubs worldwide that will develop new data-driven methodologies to deliver paradigm shifts for scientific discovery,\" Professor Rivory said. \"Data science and machine learning methods are bringing all areas of science to an exciting tipping point where fundamentally new approaches to discovery will become possible and where a new understanding of complex and integrative natural systems can be achieved. In turn, this will have a profound economic and societal impact in areas as diverse as minerals discovery, personal health and social policy.\". \"Our researchers are working with NSW Police to understand and predict domestic violence-related crime in Sydney. They\u2019re using machine learning algorithms to develop a cognitive aid for people with dementia, and working with geoscientists to understand the evolution of our planet for the past two billion years.\". \"It\u2019s an exciting time to be part of this burgeoning area that will be crucial to research and the way we live in the future.\"."

The University of Sydney Vice-Chancellor and Principal, Dr Michael Spence: \u201cWe stand firm in our commitment to advancing gender equity, promoting women in leadership and furthering women\u2019s education. Through the SAGE and other University initiatives, we are fostering the careers of outstanding women in STEMM and seeking to remove the obstacles that prevent women from achieving their full potential. By working together with our partners across higher education, we can continue to drive change and open the way for more women to succeed in Australian science and technology.\u201d. University of Canberra Vice-Chancellor and President Professor Deep Saini: \u201cThe University of Canberra has long been committed to developing and fostering an environment that promotes gender equality. Through this culture, we have seen first-hand the positive impact a diverse workforce has on our capacity to facilitate transformative learning and research, particularly in STEMM. It\u2019s important that we continue to unlock and harness the potential of the human mind for the benefit of our community and beyond, and gender should not stand in the way of this. Not now, not ever.\u201d. ANU Vice-Chancellor Professor Brian Schmidt AO: \u201cFor ANU, the SAGE initiative is a program that will help the University both think about the problems around gender equity, and then find ways to fix those problems. We are delighted to be working with other research institutions in our region to break down barriers and inspire more women to have rewarding careers in STEMM.\u201d. CSIRO Deputy Chief Executive Craig Roy: \u201cIt takes billions of grains of sand to make a beach, but it only takes a small number of inspirational stories to change the world \u2013 \u2018STEMMS\u2019s got talent, but nearly lost it\u2019 shows us that it is possible to change the future of science and humanity. We need all the talent we can harness \u2013 let\u2019s do it, grain by grain, story by story, step by step.\u201d. CSU Executive Dean of Science Professor Tim Wess: \u201cThe tide is turning. The way we judge and do science has to be more inclusive where diversity brings strength. These stories of gendered tenacity should be a thing of the past for our daughters.\u201d.

            "The former tradesperson\u2019s journey was triggered by an ever-growing appreciation for the important role played by electrical engineers in improving society. This interest climaxed with the realisation that he too wanted to somehow contribute to the nation\u2019s power industry, which saw him enrol as a mature age student as he pursued a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical Engineering). Applying the strong work ethic instilled in him from his six years on the work site, Aaron\u2019s new labours in the library had him investigate the impact of renewable generation and battery storage on the operation of the electricity network, providing several scenarios for the future management of Australia\u2019s power systems. His four years of hard work paid off when he graduated with First Class Honours and the University Medal in 2016. Aaron presently manages large engineering projects in his role as Project Manager for TransGrid, who manage and operate the high voltage electricity transmission network in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. We spoke to Aaron about his passion for electrical engineering, his career transition from electrical engineer to project manager and the advancement of both renewable energy and energy storage. Why did you decide to study an electrical engineering degree?. When I initially left high school, university was not on the radar, instead I decided to pursue an electrical apprenticeship. However, I found over time an appreciation for electrical engineering; I was curious about the things I was building and I wondered how they had been designed. I looked up to engineers who are able to make decisions about how to build something and know that it will work and perform its purpose. What do you enjoy most about your current role at TransGrid?. I am really passionate about creating, designing, managing, and building big infrastructure. I like to be able to stand outside and see a large electricity substation, solar farm, railway line, or transmission line that I have worked on. It\u2019s amazing to be a part of a large project that impacts society. It\u2019s tangible and will be in use for a long time to come. Have there been any pivotal moments or choices made during your career that have impacted your success or progress?. The decision to enrol at university was the first pivotal choice I made in my career. It taught me the importance of trying out new things and not getting stuck in a position that is not making you happy. Since then I haven\u2019t looked back. I enjoyed my degree and the four years flew by. Working as an engineer is a lot of fun, and in terms of progress I feel like I can constantly progress as each project I work on adds to my experience and value. More recently I made another change in my career by leaving my role as an electrical engineer and taking a new role as a project manager with TransGrid. I now manage large engineering projects, which was my aspiration in the first place. This has been a great move for my career; I am now responsible for rolling out large engineering projects. What has been your greatest achievement to date?. I am very proud of graduating as a mature age student and achieving First Class Honours and a University Medal. At the time, I was concerned that I may have struggled to keep up with the pace of the university courses which encouraged me to apply a strong work ethic to my studies. I discovered that by studying something I am passionate about, I was able to learn and grow beyond what I had expected, and that the learning experience was fun and rewarding. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve this goal without the support of my friends and family, and the encouragement of my lecturers and fellow students. Is there an innovation or change in the field of electrical engineering that has shifted the way things are done?. I work in the energy industry and at the moment there are a number of changes on the horizon that are really exciting and will definitely change the status quo. Firstly, renewable energy and energy storage is disrupting traditional energy markets. This has been predicted for a number of years, and we are now approaching the point where it will become cost effective for households to install battery storage and solar panels. This will have a drastic effect on our energy markets, as traditional revenue streams are affected while the cost of providing energy to customers through traditional energy networks simultaneously increases due to the decrease in demand and the associated technical challenges that come with that. Secondly, the way engineering design has traditionally been conducted and communicated to construction teams is through two-dimensional drawings. With modern processes it is becoming common to design in three-dimensions, which opens up new possibilities. Information can be gathered from laser scanning, which is then used to build three-dimensional models of existing spaces. New work can be designed in the three-dimensional models, which opens up opportunities for designers to be more creative and innovative, as well as providing more robust designs that have accurate clash detection and greater visibility of safety requirements. These changes are opening up new opportunities for young engineers and expanding their career options. What advice would you give to a young person considering studying electrical engineering?. The exciting thing about engineering is that many possibilities will be available to you. In my experience, engineers typically work on projects that are unique. Many engineers who specialise in a particular field eventually branch out to work in new areas, or move on to senior management positions later in their careers. Engineers are also highly sought after in other industries such as management consulting and finance. My advice is to engage with what you are doing, learn as much as you can from each subject and each lecturer, and keep an open mind for future opportunities. Once you finish studying, don\u2019t be scared to change your job or career and try new things!. What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in the field of electrical engineering in the next five years?. There will be a need for subject matter experts who can solve the technical challenges associated with renewable energy and energy storage integration into traditional power systems. I also believe there will be new market opportunities in the energy industry due to new technologies which will also provide new opportunities for start-up businesses in this space."

            "Ignatius Widjaja performed so well in his internship with Landis+Gyr, a global leader in smart grid networking and the overall management of energy, that they offered him a position there. It proved to be a testament to the character of Ignatius, the first student to secure a workplace internship with the industry leader and offered employment while continuing his studies, as well as the caliber of the University\u2019s Leadership Scholars. Internship placements are an important component in the development of well-rounded University of Sydney students and a requisite for all Leadership Scholarship recipients. Over the span of their degree, scholarship recipients build skills in self-leadership, stakeholder and relationship management, team work and problem solving. These 'soft' skills and hands-on experience were identified as those most valued by industry leaders in a 2017 Pollinate research study. 1. As a scholarship recipient, Ignatius underwent his internship placement with Landis+Gyr, a global leader in smart grid networking and the overall management of energy, at the end of his first year of study. The 19-year-old was assigned to assist in the supervision of a next-generation satellite connectivity project for the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine to machine (M2M) applications, and the potential application to integrate this within co-existing Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) grid networks. The outstanding student performed so well during his placement that he caught the eye of Landis+Gyr management, who offered him an Associate Engineer role immediately after his internship concluded. It is a role Widjaja gratefully accepted and undertook concurrently with his studies. \"I was excited to be the first intern accepted by Landis+Gyr, but to be offered a permanent role straight afterwards was something I never expected would happen\", said Ignatius. \"The internship provided practical on-the-job training and enhanced my understanding of the dynamic nature engineers within the smart grid and telecommunications industry face while on the job, such as devising solutions to address social, commercial and economic challenges. \"My role as Associate Engineer allowed me to not only continue working on projects I was tasked with while interning, but also expanded my responsibilities to include liaising with stakeholders across the globe and pitching proposals for future projects. \"The experience was quite humbling and I am grateful for the opportunities I've been exposed to through the Leadership Scholarship and Landis+Gyr ANZ.\". Mr Caleb Gordon, Project Manager Communications at Landis+Gyr notes that Ignatius' professional conduct and ability to complete set tasks throughout the placement did not go unnoticed. \"We were all very impressed with the professional nature and enthusiasm displayed by Ignatius throughout his internship which culminated with a very well received presentation to senior management,\" said Gordon. \"Based on the quality of the results displayed it was decided by Landis+Gyr to offer Ignatius a part-time contract which saw him responsible for a number of projects.\". In addition to industry placement opportunities, Leadership Scholarship recipients receive ongoing academic mentorship, access to valuable industry networks including alumni, government and industry leaders and have the option to undertake project-based units of study. \"Leadership Scholarship recipients commence their placement already equipped with excellent leadership and communication skills, so they are able to work effectively within teams and clients from the onset,\" said Mr Keiran Passmore, Manager Education, Professional Industry and External Engagement from the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies.'. \"The program itself is regarded as one of Australia's most valuable programs for both recipient and industry partner alike and I have no doubt there will be more stories like Ignatius' in the near future.\". 1.

            "Stroke kills more women than breast cancer and more men than prostate cancer. According to the Stroke Foundation,[1] one Australian will have a stroke every nine minutes costing the economy around $5 billion a year. Some 65% of stroke survivors will suffer a disability which impedes their ability to carry out daily living activities unassisted. More than 80% of strokes can be prevented and yet NSW hospitals do not see the benefits of current methods of predicting strokes due to their cost and poor response times. Working with Associate Professor Noel Young at Westmead Clinical School, a team of University of Sydney biomedical engineering students have designed a rapid stroke prediction system using computer vision and AI to address this pressing need. It was the winning proposal at this year\u2019s MedTech Innovation Competition. Hosted by the University of Sydney's Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, the annual MedTech Innovation Competition pairs fourth-year biomedical engineering students with industry-based supporters such as Westmead Hospital, Biointellect, CSIRO, Fledge and Corin Orthopaedics. Working under the guidance of Westmead clinicians, 20 student teams developed innovative solutions which included a non-invasive intracranial pressure monitor, a fall prevention gyro, osteoelastic bone blade system and dementia screening. \u201cWe learned of the immediate need for a stroke predictive system that can provide accurate results within six hours of onset,\u201d says Joshua Riley, one of the winning team members. The team\u2019s ViSP System uses computer vision and analysis combined with 4D CT perfusion scans and deep machine learning to predict the chances of stroke. By analysing a variety of factors including tissue density, blood volumetric flow and velocity analysis, the system will generate a risk factor for ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes which, when packaged into a detailed report for clinicians, may help determine the next steps in treatment. \u201cThe competition gave us a chance to put all the skills we\u2019ve learnt over the past three years into action and really showed us what a career in biomedical engineering is all about,\u201d says Christine Trinh, Engineering Honours (Biomedical) / Commerce student at the University of Sydney. \u201cAll the projects undertaken for this competition have great potential to help millions of people, and with that, I\u2019m thankful to have had this exposure to potentially life-changing technology.\u201d.

            "During his time as a Doctor of Philosophy student in the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering, Don Dansereau could be found at the bottom of lake Geneva in a Russian submersible, or flying an autonomous robot over the Great Barrier Reef, developing better ways to image the underwater world. His thesis on light field imaging developed through the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR) aimed to explore the limits of four-dimensional (4D) imagery and how it could transform robotics. \u201cHaving a strong hands-on component in the marine robotics group in the Faculty of Engineering and IT at the University of Sydney gave me a good understanding of the sorts of problems faced by robots and their handlers in challenging environments,\u201d said Dr Dansereau. \u201cDuring my degree I constructed a software toolbox to solve the practical problems of working with light fields. Now in widespread use, it formed the backbone for much of the software developed during my recent work.\u201d. Now at Stanford University, Don is part of a team including Gordon Wetzstein, as well as Joseph Ford and Glenn Schuster at UCSD, which has developed the world\u2019s first camera capable of wide field-of-view (FOV) light field capture with a single lens. This revolutionary technology now means that it is no longer necessary for multiple cameras to capture these 4D light fields. Don\u2019s design uses a single lens which means that a very compact camera with a single centre of projection can be built, keeping processing simple. \u201cA key technology in making this happen is the monocentric lens, which uses concentric glass spheres to capture images over a huge field of view,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, these lenses could have a 360-degree field of view if we didn't need to install sensors to capture the light.\u201d.",
            "A wide field-of-view is crucial in robotics as light field capture simplifies tasks where three-dimensional (3D) scene motion would normally complicate perception. When combined, such a camera is ideal for close-up interaction with complex scenes where time and power supply are limited. Accordingly, drone landing, delivery robots, self-driving cars and other related kinds of autonomy are much easier with a wide FOV light field camera. \u201cIn 10\u201315 years, it seems possible that more cameras will be manufactured for robots than for humans, and it makes a lot of sense to ask, \u2018what's the best camera for a robot\u2019?\u201d Don says. \u201cI believe light field cameras and other computational imaging technologies will allow us to tailor cameras to specific robotics applications, allowing greater levels of autonomy and reliability even in challenging conditions.\u201d. And in the context of the debate over humans competing with robots for future jobs, Don offers a considered opinion. \u201cIn 1870, 70-hour work weeks were the norm in the USA and Europe, and this has since fallen to between 35 and 40 hours. Over this period, many more new jobs have been created than old jobs lost, and I think it's possible this trend will continue,\u201d he suggests. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that robotics and automation will continue to increase the efficiency with which we accomplish our goals, lowering the cost of living while decreasing human workload.\u201d."

Associate Professor Fabio Ramos ' work in intelligent machines has been recognised with a Sydney Research Accelerator ( SOAR ) Fellowship. The real-world application of this research includes models to predict air pollution 24 hours in advance to data analytics for portable water production and asset management, and work applicable to mental health, mining and real estate. \u201cMy research builds upon developments in mathematics, statistics and computer science to design algorithms that enable computers to understand data, make predictions about future outcomes based on historical data, and take intelligent decisions under uncertainty that maximise a given objective,\u201d Associate Professor Ramos said. \u201cThese methods and tools are known as machine learning. \u201cWith the continuing development of data science, methods that can predict the outcome of events based on historical data are becoming increasingly powerful. However, it is unclear how to best utilise data science and probabilistic predictions to make informed decisions. \u201cMy research aims to bridge the gap between predictions from big data to optimal decisions/actions.\u201d. His work on air pollution forecasting aims to connect data science to statistical decision theory to answer key questions as to whether air pollution forecast models could be used to help define a policy and the benefits of investing in new monitoring stations. In healthcare, Associate Professor Ramos\u2019 work aims to answer questions as to which treatments would lead to the best outcome given probabilistic predictive models of the patient\u2019s recovery and whether we can provide theoretical guarantees for the optimality of these decisions. \u201cThe SOAR fellowship will transform my profile by broadening the impact of the theoretical developments of my research to other fields, and to industry,\u201d he says. The research of Associate Professor Ramos has been pivotal towards the establishment of the Rio Tinto Centre for Mining Automation, which has attracted more than $35 million in research funding to the University and the Centre for Translational Data Science (CTDS), which aims to open unprecedented opportunities to apply the theoretical aspects of his research to fundamental problems in health, earth and biological sciences."

Selected to represent the University of Sydney, he joined a group of international students from eight Australian universities, with a mission to pitch a new idea for potential industry and commercial application. \"We ended up discussing the problems that we faced as international students when we first came to Sydney and we all had the same answer,\" he said. \"Getting accustomed to public transport was persistently the most annoying problem (not necessarily the hardest). So, we decided to do a passion project, where we defined the problem and solution, and came up with the idea of a travel buddy app.\". The value proposition behind ConnectUs comes from the anxiety international students feel when they leave University after studying late at night. \"Sometimes you end up waiting quite a while for public transport when all you want is to get home at the end of the day,\" Ninad added. \"As part of the app, you register using your university email account and connect to other users who are nearby. If that user is heading in the same direction or suburb, you can decide whether you catch public transport together or share a taxi or an UBER with them. \"At the end of the trip, both of you can anonymously rate each other and comment on your trip.\". If required, the app includes the option to block a person and an emergency button that alerts authorities and your emergency contacts. The team's pitch included the addition of location-based advertising, commission options with taxi companies and UBER, and possible application to other industries including health care. In developing the app, Ninad said that he applied the high-level planning skills that an engineering degree teaches you. \"Aeronautical engineering is one of the most strenuous degrees in the faculty and this helped me stay calm in high pressure situations,\" he said. \"I was able to keep the team's morale up by creating well-planned schedules and coordinating everyone's availability. All in all, the sense of discipline that engineering imparts came in most handy.\". Nearing the end of his studies, Ninad says his degree studies have opened his mind to the depth of engineering as an industry and a profession. \"As people go deeper into their engineering degrees, they tend to narrow down their field and end up sticking with a specific pathway or specialisation,\" he added. \"I feel like I've gone in the opposite direction and I now realise that directly or indirectly the skills that engineering imparts can be applied almost anywhere!\"."

            "Student Imogen Frawley (right) was encouraged to further her research aspirations by Professor Branka Vucetic. The Georgina Sweet Australian Laureate Fellowship was introduced by the Australian Research Council in 2010 to support outstanding female researchers and research leaders from the science and technology disciplines. As the 2016 Georgina Sweet Fellow, Laureate Professor Branka Vucetic has been using the fellowship to undertake innovative research programs and create a range of activities that will support the promotion of women in STEM research at the University of Sydney. Starting with inspiring presentations from an all-star lineup of female academics from across the Faculty of Engineering and IT, the event attracted current undergraduate students from a variety of universities across Australia who are considering a career in research. Imogen Frawley, a final year Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Civil) / Bachelor of Arts student, was curious about the opportunities for further research in STEM. \u201c It was really inspiring to hear from so many brilliant female academics in STEM. I now feel more confident in my ability to continue with study in STEM and the field as a whole feels more approachable and inviting,\u201d Imogen says. \u201cSeeing these women interact with each other was also a really good part of the day. They were so genuinely supportive of each other, which I think is really important in overcoming the challenges associated with being a woman pursuing a career in STEM.\u201d. Program leader Professor Branka Vucetic is a world leader in wireless telecommunications research who currently leads the Centre of Excellence for Telecommunications at the Faculty of Engineering and IT. Recognised internationally for her leadership in general electrical and information engineering research, teaching and strategic development, Professor Vucetic has also provided essential R&D support to the federal government\u2019s $100m Smart Grid, Smart City national demonstration project on its wireless solutions. The students also spoke with Professor Xiaoke Yi whose research into nanophotonics and integrated microwave photonics promises to meet our ever-increasing demand for lightning-speed, high- information and communication systems. Recently announced as the winner of the Bradfield Award, Professor Yi is currently working on a non-invasive sensing technique for glucose monitoring in people with diabetes that is highly accurate, fast (real-time), low-cost, pain-free and risk-free. The young women were given a guided tour of Professor Hala Zreiqat\u2019s laboratory where her team works on the development of novel engineered materials and 3D printed platforms for regenerative medicine, particularly in the fields of orthopaedics, dental and maxillofacial applications. A Radcliff-Harvard Fellow and the director of the Australian Research Training Centre for Musculoskeletal Biomedical Technologies, Professor Zreiquat heads up the Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering Research Unit at the University of Sydney. After the tour of the Faculty\u2019s diverse laboratories and research facilities, the women were given the opportunity to network with researchers and industry at Research Conversazione, while seeing first hand current student thesis work."

            "1. Expiration dates may soon be past their shelf life. Expiration dates serve as a quick method for determining whether food is safe to be consumed. While convenient, these labels are not accurate and rely on theoretical assumptions. Research engineer Long Nguyen, from the ARC Training Centre for the Australian Food Processing Industry, has developed a simple, inexpensive sensor in sticker form which changes colour in the presence of the ammonia released from spoiled foods such as red meat. 2. Drones are a farmer's best friend. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) may just be the answer to the ongoing bird problem plaguing the agriculture industry. PhD candidate Zihao Wang has proposed programing UAVs to chase the pests away on sight. His research suggests equipping each UAV with three crucial components: sensors to actively search for birds on the farm; a ground station translating sensor data into missions for the drones; and the drones themselves. This method intends to reduce the current annual loss of commercial crops suffered by farmers. 3. Health benefits of virtual reality. Immersive virtual reality and exergaming (games that support physical activity) technology is the perfect recipe to engage and motivate players in physical and cognitive activity. PhD candidate Kiran Ijaz's 'VR Rides' is one such example, comprising of a recumbent tricycle, real-world panoramic images and a virtual reality headset that allows the user to peddle their way around real locations in a safe, virtual environment. 4. No more traffic jams. Real-time traffic monitoring and remote car parking inspections are closer to being a reality courtesy of ongoing research by PhD candidate Zhe Yu. The telecommunications engineer is designing a reconfigurable Internet of Things communications platform for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to support Smart Campus applications and meet energy efficiency, data-rate and transmission range requirements. Real-time image processing algorithms will be developed for the UAV to perform detailed functions such as reading number plates, parking permits and assessing parking occupancy. 5. Robots lend more than just a helping hand. Developing a mobile robotics research platform with a controllable arm for safe user interaction is being explored by PhD student Anthony Tompkins. Due to the general nature of the problem of an autonomous robot interacting with its environment, this research forms a fundamental stepping stone for more advanced automation. Such research is applicable to various sectors such as healthcare, warehousing, logistics, and manufacturing."

            "Made from a human protein and activated by UV light, methacryloyl-substituted tropoelastin (MeTro) quickly seals wounds without the need for staples or sutures and can be used on the heart, lungs or other internal organs. There is potential for MeTro to be used in emergencies at the scene of an accident, stitching open wounds together to prevent blood loss. The gel remains flexible, allowing it to move and bend with the organ as tissue grows and heals. Once the wound is back to full strength, a built-in enzyme enables the gel to degrade over time, preventing the need for follow-up surgery. Lead author of a recently published study on MeTro, Assistant Professor Nasim Annabi from Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School has been working collaboratively with Professor Anthony Weiss from the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre and Faculty of Science since 2006.",
            "Assistant Professor Annabi started her multidisciplinary work on tropoelastin with Professor Weiss while undertaking her PhD in biomaterial synthesis with Professor Fariba Dehghani in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in Sydney. Annabi and her team have been working on MeTro since 2013 and have published several high-impact factor papers on the use of MeTro for heart tissue regeneration. Annabi says that the challenge for researchers is understanding the needs of clinicians, designing technology that will be superior to what is already available and convincing them to invest their time during material development. \u201cI think we have done this successfully. The same team of surgeons at Harvard who helped us with the in vivo work are now interested to collaborating with us for the first phase of human trials,\u201d Annabi says. While Annabi believes that it was a pivotal career choice to stay in the USA and continue her research at Harvard, she highlighted the importance of maintaining her close collaboration with Weiss\u2019s team at the University of Sydney. \u201cAustralia is like home for me and although it was very challenging, I learned that we always grow outside of our comfortable zone and the challenges along our way make us stronger and help us to succeed.\u201d. Partnering with clinicians and medical professionals is something that Annabi sees as key to progressing biomedical innovation. \u201cThe only way to make an impact is to learn how to work among different disciplines. If engineers and MDs work together, we can advance our field much faster,\u201d she says. With human clinical trials now in progress, Annabi says MeTro could be used in hospital operating rooms within three to five years. Elastagen Pty Ltd is commercialising the technology."

            "It's a journey which has seen the Bachelor of Software Engineering graduate utilise her technical skills to effect change at several startup businesses and use her interpersonal skills as a consultant to various large companies. Furthermore, it has afforded her the opportunity to learn a diverse number of coding languages required to excel in the ever evolving industry (10 languages to date and rising). Serena is now a Senior Solutions Engineer at Covata, a leading data security company focused on securing data wherever it resides and controlling who can access it. We spoke with Serena about her career as a software engineer, her career journey to date and her predictions for the continuing growth of the ever evolving data security sector. What do you enjoy most about your current role at Covata?. Working at Covata, like many smaller startups, has allowed me to become agile with my approach to work. You never quite know what you may be working on month-to-month, which keeps the work interesting. Such a dynamic also allows you to learn the newest technologies, which can then be incorporated into projects. Has there been any pivotal moment or choice made during your career that has impacted your success or progress?. My first role as a software engineer was with a startup company before I transitioned into consultancy with bigger organisations. It was after this initial shift that I realised what had been lost - the feeling of not being part of a family or the comradery with work colleagues. What has been your greatest achievement to date as a software engineer?. I am fondly proud of the pro bono work I did in developing a medical database website for the International Diabetes Foundation. It was part of their 'Life for a Child' program aimed at minimising the risk of Type 1 diabetes in young people. Is there an innovation or change that has shifted how things operate in the field of software engineering?. One thing that stands out is the emergence of cloud based computing. The orchestration of these systems allows an entire software stack, including all the hardware needed to be created, to be accessed at the touch of a button. What advice would you give to a young person considering studying software engineering?. If you are interested in solving fascinating real world problems using a software-based approach and want to work in a career where you are forever learning something new, then software engineering is for you!. What job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in the field of data security in the coming years?. Data security is a booming area with more companies becoming conscious that they must take more precautionary measures to protect their confidential information, so as to not find themselves in the situation where a data breach occurs. I have no doubt that there will be plenty more opportunities in this field in the years to come as companies start to mitigate the risk for data exposure."

            "It has become an intrinsic part of our everyday lives, aiding us in the way we communicate with friends and family (text messaging, social media), managing our daily finances (online banking) and how we get from point A to point B (GPS software). On a larger scale, software is also used to operate some of the most complex medical machines as well as regulate nuclear plants, electrical grids and other utilities. But who exactly designs and oversees the software that help make our lives so convenient?. In short, software engineers, whose responsibilities include the creation and maintenance of software systems, ensuring they are reliable and efficient, cost-effective to develop and overall meet the specific needs of the user. \"In essence, software is an indispensable part of a computer that makes it useful,\" explains Doctor Dong Yuan, who teaches the Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Software) program within the School of Electrical and Information Engineering. \"Building software can at times be as complex as any engineering project in the work and can be akin to the construction of a skyscraper or spacecraft, such as ultra-large-scale systems that operate air traffic control systems, energy distribution systems or financial trading.\". Dr Yuan's own research is primarily concerned with software engineering for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, such as smart living applications that require distributed environment sensors, mobile body sensors and smart wearable devices for data collection and processing. \"The Internet of Things refers to the interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in objects, enabling them to send and receive data,\" says Dr Yuan. \"Today we have more and more smart devices in our daily life all connected to the internet, including smart appliances, watches and phones. \"While having intelligent software will significantly improve the convenience of our life, the difficult part is actually building the software to meet the expectations of the user. \"Due to many of these devices being produced in large-scale quantities for distribution, we need to develop software that can adapt to the user's mobility or the ability to cope with intensive computations. \"My research involves ways of addressing these obstacles so that the software in whichever device performs its intended application in a seamless manner that meets the user's expectations.\". Dr Yuan forecasts that the demand for software engineers within industry is on the rise and he does not see this trend altering anytime soon. \"Software engineers are not only required by IT companies, but across a wide-range of industries where computers and the internet are indispensable components of a company's operations,\" says Dr Yuan. \"As information technology and the internet both grow to become indispensable components in our daily lives, the demand for software engineers will continue to rise to meet the inevitable demand.\".

            "Finalists of the 2018 Multidisciplinary Australian Danish Exchange program. The Sydney Opera House has announced the Australian students selected for the 2018 MADE by the Opera House scholarship, the international exchange that extends architect J\u00f8rn Utzon's collaborative approach to architecture, engineering and design. The students will travel to Denmark next January to take part in a collaborative six-week project that brings together the key disciplines that combined to create the World Heritage masterpiece. They will be joined by three students from the University of NSW and University of Technology, Sydney on the Denmark exchange. Now in its fourth year, the annual Multidisciplinary Australian Danish Exchange - known as MADE by the Opera House - gives five Australian and five Danish students the chance to work on a multidisciplinary project and undertake a study tour in the other country. MADE aims to promote international and cross-disciplinary interaction between students of architecture, engineering and design (of the built environment). As well as providing a multidisciplinary experience for Australian and Danish students, the program fosters cultural links between the two countries."

            "Rail Confidence Director, Stephen Muscat. What\u2019s your name, current role and company?. Stephen Muscat, I\u2019m currently the director of my own engineering consultancy called Rail Confidence. What do you enjoy most about your current role?. The opportunities and challenges that are presented both from a technical and commercial perspective. What do you remember enjoying most during your time at the University of Sydney?. Most definitely the people. I made some lifelong friends, collaborators and advisers from my time at Sydney Uni. I even met my wife at the university. Have there been any pivotal moments or choices made during your career that have impacted your success or progress? What did you learn from that experience?. Two things come to mind. I was smitten by the automotive industry and desperate to work in Formula One racing. The automotive industry was on the decline and a job in F1 was even less likely. I took a job with a freight wagon manufacturing company in Newcastle after finishing my degree. At the time, mining was the career in vogue and I remember being uninspired by the rail industry. It was antiquated, appeared technologically simple and the industry was saturated by old men in cardigans who spent their career in the industry. I eventually realised the opportunities that were being afforded to me by being part of a well-established industry that was about to evolve rapidly. I got to go to some amazing sites around Australia and the world. I got to participate and actually witness the contribution the rail industry was making. Eventually I learned to embrace my career in the rail industry and realise that hobby\u2019s and passions are separate from a career. Being part of the rail industry, whilst wasn\u2019t my initial preference has enabled me to enjoy my hobbies and interests as I wish. This experience taught me the benefit of an open mind. Whist not all experiences in my career have been positive, I now know what I do and don\u2019t like doing. What has been your greatest achievement to date \u2013 something that you are really proud of? What helped you to reach that goal?. Not wanting to sound clich\u00e9, I would have to say starting my own engineering consultancy. The day I cut the metaphorical bowlines to my previous, stable, regularly paid employment I was riddled with anxiety. I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be detrimental to my career, reputation or capabilities. In fact, it has been the opposite for all those. I\u2019m really proud that we now employ multiple staff and have a positive standing in the industry in the relatively short period of time we have been operating. Multiple factors have helped this goal flourish. I have a very capable and quality driven business partner whose personality and skills compliment mine. I also have a very supportive and understanding wife, who was willing to make scarifies to ensure the success of this goal. With regards to the people in my life, I\u2019ve been lucky and am very grateful. The rest of it has come down to hard work. Is there an innovation or change in your field of expertise that has shifted the way things are done?. It\u2019s more of an evolution than an innovation. Computing power and data storage is continually improving which helps answer more questions more quickly. Also, I like the fact that safety is continuously improving and the respect for it is embraced more and more. What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in your field of expertise in the next 5 years?. Various Australian governments are making significant investments in rail transport. Sydney is getting its first driverless automatic train in the next few years with the installation of the Sydney Metro. Light rail systems are popping up in various states. New trains mean new technologies and system that make the lives of the community more comfortable and safer. Heavy haul mining companies are also investing in automatic driving technologies to enhance the throughput of their commodity and make the networks safer. My initial impression of the rail industry being antiquated is no longer as defence based and aerospace technologies continue to emerge throughout the industry."

            "Additive manufacturing at work. New and emerging technologies including three-dimensional (3D) printing offer massive benefits for industry, including increased productivity and reduced costs. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is the general term applied to the components built by 3D printing, where 3D physical parts and models are created directly from digital data. After intensive research and development, rapid tooling applications have been developed by employing AM technology in the fabrication of tools, dies and moulds. AM also has been used to produce prototype parts with desired properties for evaluation and testing, as well as to manufacture small or medium quantities of end-use products. However, from the birth of AM technology up to now, trustworthiness and durability of AM parts is still not completely reliable. Specifically, mechanical properties of these AM parts are slightly different from those manufactured via traditional methods. It is therefore a big challenge for industries to trust AM technology for critical components and structures in aerospace, automotive, and biomedical. This is where Hoda Eskandari hopes her research as part of her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) can make a difference. \u201cThe ultimate goal of my research is to improve mechanical properties involved with Additive Manufacturing (AM), specifically fatigue performance by eliminating induced defects mostly by applying post processing,\u201d Hoda said. \u201cBriefly, my project is focused on a Stainless Steel (SS) manufactured by Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS). Mechanical behaviour of this material is compared to standard stainless steel in order to improve the 3D printed parts in terms of quality and performance. \u201cBy improving the properties of such AM parts, this technology could apply in sectors such as aerospace, where for airlines the advantages are substantial, including finding spare parts quickly and of course lighter and stronger parts, resulting in massive weight and cost savings.\u201d. Hoda\u2019s research underscores the need to spread this technology particularly in Australia as the AM market is on the rise globally. \u201cThe key to the successful implementation of AM into the real world is to have a good understanding of the technology, which is possible by collaborating of research and development part and industries,\u201d Hoda added. \u201cBy following the growth of this technology, AM is likely to become inseparable part of human life in the early future and probably, 3D printing shops will pop-up in different places to help people to access them any time they need in a short leading time with trustworthy quality. \u201cSurprisingly the next generation of this technology is 4D printing which looks to create structures that changes shapes at a later time when interacting with the new conditions.\u201d."

Mechanical engineering has quite a large focus on fluid mechanics in different applications, so by analysing it in this context I\u2019m able to use pre-existing mathematical models.\u201d. Leah\u2019s focus is the air curtain, a unique device that uses a jet of air to prevent smoke flow rather than relying on a physical barricade. \u201cAn air curtain doesn\u2019t require a physical barrier to stop the smoke flow through different regions, meaning that people can escape a fire unobstructed instead of stopping at a doorway or reaching a complete blockage,\u201d she said. \u201cThe air curtain doesn\u2019t destabilise when people pass through, which means that it still effectively stops smoke flow, reducing the time people spend in smoke filled areas.\u201d. Leah hopes the air curtain could have significant implications for fire safety, especially in Sydney\u2019s ever-growing collection of apartment buildings. \u201cIt would be most effective in either tunnels or corridors or in doorways, where there is a clear opening which can feasibly be protected,\u201d she added. \u201cThis allows a safer place for people to queue while waiting to enter fire stairs or allow them to exit a tunnel before they are affected by the smoke.\u201d."

            "Professor Dan Galai presents his speech. The Human Innovation: Healthcare Technologies for the Next Century event provided a forum for discussion on how to foster creative healthcare interfaces between students, universities, hospitals, government and industry in order to support medtech innovation. A leader in this interdisciplinary field, Professor Dan Galai from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, gave the keynote address inspiring industry colleagues, clinicians and students across disciplines including engineering, IT and health. \u201cA successful start-up needs a good idea that serves a need,\u201d he said. \u201cAt many universities, up until recently, a patent was not considered a publication. This signals the growing recognition and importance of how research and academia can shape healthcare innovations for the future. \u201cThe biomedical field is endless but solutions must be cost effective.\u201d. Professor Galai provided invaluable steps to develop a successful technology-based startup idea leveraging decades of experience in commercialising university research. Following Professor Galai\u2019s address, an industry panel chaired by Warren Centre Director, Dr Ashley Brinson, addressed questions from the audience, with membership featuring: Dr Nick Cerneaz: General Manager of MyHealthTest Pty Ltd (a division of ITL Health Group), Ms Christine Chen: COO and Chief Engineer at Nano-X, Dr Ron Weinberger: President Technology Development / Commercialisation of Nansonics Australia, The event was an initiative of the Master of Health Technology Innovation at the University of Sydney in conjunction with The Warren Centre, MTPConnect and SWAAB Attorneys. It also emphasised how the tertiary sector can prepare graduates to thrive in this increasingly complex and risk-averse sector.

            "Ian's startup, Iridium Dynamics specialises in hybrid UAVs for surveying and mapping. The recognition and awards keep coming for Iridium Dynamics, the brainchild of Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Mechatronics Space) graduate, Ian Conway Lamb. The startup recently received $75,000 from the Queensland Government as well as $120,000 (USD) from Techstars, a leading global startup accelerator with an impressive portfolio of companies who have cumulatively raised over $3 billion. These are on top of the $25,000 Iridium secured in the TEDxSydney St George Bank Kick Start competition in 2016. \u201cThese investments are fantastic recognition of our ambitious plans in terms of technology development as well as business strategy,\u201d Ian says. \u201cIf you have either a passion for business or an idea which you would like to see commercialised, you should seriously consider developing a technology business. There is more support for early-stage startups than ever before.\u201d. Iridium Dynamics specialises in hybrid UAVs for surveying and mapping. Its UAVs have a unique characteristic - they can hover for extended periods of time, enabling useful up-close inspections, even in remote locations. It is currently manufacturing aircraft for the purpose of inspecting large-scale infrastructure as well as focusing on asset management in the resources sector, road and rail infrastructure, and utilities. Ian believes there\u2019s a huge opportunity for this technology in other industries, including emergency services and insurance, as well as its current applications in agriculture. \u201cNinety seven percent of commercial UAVs are multirotor aircraft; the greatest limitation of these aircraft is their speed and endurance, and hence range,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly 3% of commercial UAVs are fixed-wing (aeroplanes). Aeroplanes have the disadvantage of not being able to hover, and the advantage of much greater range. But this statistic highlights another limitation: current regulations make it very difficult to legally fly a UAV \u2018beyond visual line-of-sight\u2019.\u201d. \u201cIn a tech startup where you need to demonstrate technological feasibility, it\u2019s extremely helpful to have the technical skills to build a functioning prototype yourself. Otherwise, you need to find a technical co-founder or pay for the development out of your own pocket, which can be particularly expensive for a hardware startup.\u201d. Ian adds that his tertiary background in mechanical engineering gave him the foundation upon which to build his career. \u201cIt gave me skills for developing almost every part of the prototype myself,\u201d he asserts."

            "\u201cUnderstanding turbulence generated by the ship, and its impact on the helicopter, is a formidable challenge,\u201d Associate Professor Ben Thornber says. Imagine piloting a helicopter towards a ship, fighting a gale force wind and watching as the ship pitch and heaves by several metres as huge waves pass underneath. At this point, as the pilot of the helicopter, you must make the decision whether it is possible to land on the ship, or if you need to wait for calmer conditions. This decision point is critical for Navy pilots and, in some cases, pilots have resorted to landing on icebergs or similar as they are unable to return to a ship during high wind conditions. This scenario at the heart of research led by Associate Professor Ben Thornber which is in development of a state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics model. \u201cUnderstanding turbulence generated by the ship, and its impact on the helicopter, is a formidable challenge,\u201d Associate Professor Thornber says. \u201cIt requires knowledge of atmospheric turbulence, motion of the ship deck due to waves, helicopter aerodynamics and human factors. Our research focuses on our recently commissioned Landing Helicopter Dock, which has the capability of permitting multiple helicopters operating simultaneously.\u201d. The aim of Associate Professor Thornber\u2019s research is to enable computations of critical operational scenarios to assess the safe operational limits in terms of helicopter separation and atmospheric wind conditions, in timescales which are achievable on supercomputing facilities. It is also relevant to helicopter and UAV operations near oil rigs, in the urban environment and for large equipment inspection. The research validated two key components: the accurate simulation of turbulence generated by the superstructure of the ship and a new efficient model of the helicopter rotor blade. \u201cThe second element is key to the overall simulations as our new model enables rotating blades to be placed arbitrarily around the ship, and to follow prescribed paths such as typical landing approaches,\u201d Associate Professor Thornber says. \u201cBy including the rotor blades in the computation, we are able to assess the impact of turbulence on rotor blade lift and the downwash from the rotor blade on nearby helicopter operations.\u201d. The ultimate aim is to develop a unique software system to predict and guide safe helicopter operations around ships, oil rigs and within urban environments. There is also potential to apply the research to wind turbines and propellers, looking at the impact of incoming turbulence on operation, the wake generated and, in the longer term, noise prediction. Associate Professor Thornber is undertaking work on the project in collaboration with current Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student, Daniel Linton and in partnership with the Federal Government\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Group."

            "Alastair Donnelley\u2019s career path has not been typical for a mechanical engineer. While he initially considered engineering upon leaving high school, the creative industries won him over. After completing a media studies degree, Alastair went on to win awards in Australia and internationally for short films he shot and co-produced, including one which was shown at the Cannes International Film Festival. However, after witnessing first-hand the disruption of content industries by tech startups and finding that he enjoyed designing and building camera rigs and trick optical devices as much as using them, Alastair decided that it was time to get back on the side of the disruptors. After a 12-year hiatus, he returned to tertiary study by enrolling in the Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Mechanical) at the University of Sydney. Alastair was admitted into the Advanced Engineering stream and developed an app as part of his honours thesis to help engineering students visualise numerical methods \u2013 an approach later incorporated into a unit of study with Dr Nicholas Williamson. On the Dean's list from 2014\u201316, Alastair received the University Medal in 2016, along with other faculty prizes and awards. What are you currently working on?. I recently completed a stint at a startup called Tzukuri, which makes high-end smart eyeglasses. They contain a chip that talks to your phone, to let you know where your glasses are if you misplace them. Currently I'm working on a couple of very early stage products. One is a humidifier mask for frequent flyers, using 3D facial scanning, geometric clustering and rapid prototyping techniques to ensure a comfortable fit. The other is a self-contained continuum robot kit that snaps together like a jigsaw. Continuum robots are like tentacles or caterpillars \u2013 quite unlike the typical robot form that you might imagine. What's most enjoyable about working in the startup space?. There\u2019s usually lots of flexibility to define your own role. You really need to be creative in how you leverage your engineering mindset to solve problems, and often do so outside of core engineering areas. I've designed and built jigs and work holding devices, production tracking systems, mass finishing systems, adhesives and frame trimming machines. But I've also been involved in implementing lean management and communications systems, working out how to fabricate product displays for company events, brainstorming marketing concepts, and even writing and proofing website content. The variety and pace of the work is pretty invigorating. What career opportunities are out there for a mechanical engineer?. I've got graduate friends working in consulting, finance, big data analysis, med-tech, automation and sub-sea exploration, as well as more traditional mechanical areas like rail and of course in startups. I think we're more in need than ever of graduates who have the ability to form an accurate mental model of the world, and I think a wide range of employers see that value in engineering graduates. How are the mechanical engineering skills you learned at university applied in the real world?. Sometimes what you learn can feel a bit abstract. But just this week I had to manipulate a 3D printer to truly print on three axes (rather than along horizontal slices) and ended up using more vector algebra than I ever thought I would. This is not an isolated example; how you use what you learn really is only limited by your creativity. I've probably found the skills I learnt in the Advanced Engineering program the most professionally applicable, such as communication, project- and time-management, and formulating actionable approaches to complex, open-ended problems. What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in your field of expertise in the next 5 years?. The mass-market availability of brain\u2013computer interfaces may bring mind-controlled systems and robots out of the realms of med-tech and prosthetics and into the world of wearables and consumer goods. I find that pretty exciting; what engineer doesn't want to build thought-controlled robots?. Essentially, if you've ever pulled anything apart to see how it works, you should definitely consider a career in mechanical engineering \u2013 especially if you got it back together without losing too many screws!."

            "PhD student Anastasia Volkova. With the recent increase in demand for satellite navigation and communication, and the potential for commercial application for drones, questions are now being asked as to whether the level of autonomy for these unmanned aerial vehicles can go further. Accordingly, Aeronautical Engineering Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student, Anastasia Volkova hopes to bestow the gift of sight on these popular and highly-applicable machines. \u201cMy research in visual navigation algorithms for environments where the Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable aims to build autonomous systems for localisation of drones. I started working in this area before they were available to consumers and before they became an alternative to a GoPro camera,\u201d Anastasia says. \u201cThe motivation behind my research is the development of reliable navigation \u2013 as an alternative to the GPS signal \u2013 using visual equipment available on-board the aerial platform, such as the downward-looking camera. It seems logical to be utilising all possible means to improve positioning accuracy.\u201d. The main objective of the algorithm is improving the surveillance capability, by accurately tracking and mapping the movers detected in the imagery into the world frame. This \u2018in-flight\u2019 tracking algorithm can be used for traffic analysis applied in urban planning or for safety and security applications, such as tracking a criminal with a drone in the sky. Ultimately Anastasia\u2019s research will provide a drone with a capability to \u2018see\u2019 where it is in the world and figure out where it is going based on visual clues such as the outlines of roads and rivers.",
            "Now in her third year, Anastasia has already conducted simulations to assess the viability of her algorithm and is validating her approach on the real-world footage captured. \u201cThis is definitely the most interesting and challenging part of the project, as I get to see my research turning from an intellectual pursuit into a practical tool for solving modern world navigation challenges,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there is nothing more exciting for an engineer than to see their developments applied!\u201d. Alongside the completion of her PhD thesis, Anastasia involves herself in FluroSat, a start-up in collaboration with industry bodies such as the Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC), that uses drones and satellites to diagnose crop stress to help farmers cut fertiliser costs and improve yields. \u201cWe can provide a farmer with the information on the stress levels and nutrient requirements of the crops around the paddock (such as how much nitrogen and water needs to be applied) calculated using our advanced crop modelling and data processing tools,\u201d she adds. \u201cAs we grow, we are looking for remote sensing experts to join our team to tackle one of the most intriguing and vital challenges of the modern world: food security.\u201d."

Your typical coal power plant releases by-products such as fly ash, carbon dioxide gas and wastewater into the environment. But what if we found ways to use this waste?. \u201cWhen we design and produce something \u2013 anything \u2013 we need to consider its lifecycle impacts, its ultimate fate and its reusability,\u201d says Associate Professor Ali Abbas from the University of Sydney\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Associate Professor Abbas is referring to a shift from a linear economy to a circular one where the latter finds ways to reuse organic, obsolete products or industrial waste, rather than dispose of them. \u201cThis is the philosophy of our work,\u201d says Associate Professor Abbas, who has recently received a SOAR Fellowship to support his innovative research in transforming waste to products. Associate Professor Abbas\u2019s research explores a transformative approach to power generation in Australia. He suggests we could be using industrial waste to create useful materials for other industrial plants. For example, fly ash and carbon dioxide gas from coal power plants could be collected to be transformed into an environmentally-friendly cement blend [1], thereby trapping carbon emissions while offsetting the energy used to produce cement from other materials. Associate Professor Abbas has been working with Delta Electricity to make his \u2018green\u2019 cement a reality and, together with academic colleagues, is now researching the mechanisms of carbonation of industrial waste from the atomic scale. \u201cAlgae is also interesting. It has the ability to absorb carbon emissions, whilst having the ability to clean industrial wastewater as well,\u201d he says. The funding from SOAR will go towards developing the Waste Transformation Research Hub, a collaborative industry\u2013university approach to research future waste technologies for Australia\u2019s circular economy. \u201cThe funds will help me engage with partners, whether industry or academic, for this research. At the moment there is no cohesive national research hub on circular economy and waste processing. This is an opportunity for the University of Sydney \u2013 and for Australia \u2013 to lead the way internationally in waste transformation research,\u201d says Associate Professor Abbas. The energy sector remains the largest contributor of carbon emissions in Australia. With growing concerns around Australia\u2019s emissions reduction targets, Associate Professor Abbas\u2019s waste research could become a key influencer in pushing Australia in the right direction towards these goals.

            "Granular materials such as sand and rocks are of interest not only to children in playgrounds, but also to engineers looking to reinvent the way we fuel the world. Dr Yixiang Gan from the School of Civil Engineering specialises in granular materials research. His work focuses on how the mechanics and physics of granular (and porous) materials can affect the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy systems, such as solar thermal storage and battery systems. \u201cWe are living in a time of transition from fossil-based to sustainable energy sources. My research aims to improve our fundamental understanding of the transport phenomena - including transport of electrons, heat and ionic species - to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of energy systems, and reduce their risk of failure. The research impact will also extend to national policy on renewable and sustainable energy resources, by providing government with credible information regarding feasibility and risk analyses,\u201d says Dr Gan. Last year Dr Gan received a SOAR fellowship as part of a funding scheme by the University of Sydney established to help researchers reach their full potential and have a lasting impact with in their respective fields. \u201cThe support of the SOAR fellowship offers unique opportunities to enhance my research profile and allow an acceleration of my current research plans. In addition, the fellowship allows us to further develop synergies between the research outcomes and fast growing industries in energy storage systems through patent development and commercialisation,\u201d says Dr Gan. One of Dr Gan\u2019s areas of specialisation is nuclear fusion, a reaction that produces extreme amounts of energy from the collision of subatomic particles. For years researchers have explored ways in which nuclear fusion can be harnessed as a viable source of renewable energy. However, safe and reliable nuclear fusion has proven tremendously difficult to achieve. Dr Gan is part of the global effort to develop solutions in this complex field, providing his expertise in granular materials to leading researchers across France, Germany, India, USA and China. With the help of SOAR funding, Dr Gan will further contribute to nuclear fusion research, by leading the international organising team for the second International Workshop on Mechanics of Energy Materials which will be held in the Sydney Centre in Suzhou, China. The workshop aims to provide a platform to disseminate and promote state-of-art research, facilitate scientific discussion, and establish collaboration, in the field of mechanics of energy materials. They will not only explore mechanics problems encountered in nuclear materials but also in lithium-ion batteries, geothermal energy, thermal energy storage and thermoelectric materials."

            "Shampoo, oil, candle wax, medicine, smart phones, gasoline \u2013 all these household items contain a key compound that fuel our everyday lives, hydrocarbon. Hydrocarbon refers to a group of organic compounds consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. Methane is one example, and is the main compound in natural gas. Olefins such as ethylene are also hydrocarbons, and are widely used in the production of plastics. Industrial sectors rely so heavily on these compounds that hydrocarbon is now a 1.5 trillion dollar industry. There is, however, a lack of discourse on the production of these hydrocarbons and the detrimental impact these industrial processes have on the environment. To this end, Associate Professor Jun Huang and his team from the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Sydney are working to help resolve this environmental issue through their expertise in the field of catalysis engineering.",
            "Associate Professor Jun Huang. In order to produce hydrocarbons, crude oil or bio-oil is exposed to high temperatures and broken down into simpler molecules. Hydrocarbon gases then rise into a distillery column, leaving behind petroleum coke, or \u2018petcoke\u2019. Petcoke is burned to recover reusable compounds, however, this harmful by-product actually emits 11% more greenhouse gases than coal [1]. \u201cAlmost a quarter of the feedstocks used in the refinement process become undesired by-products or wastes\u201d, says Associate Professor Huang, who has a solution that could shift the hydrocarbon industry towards a more sustainable future. \u201cTo speed up the refinement process, we currently use chemical \u2018catalysts\u2019 such as zeolites and silica-alumina, where we\u2019ve designed new and unique catalysts based on penta-coordinated aluminium. \u201cThese catalysts are high in acidity, which allows us to reduce the amount petcoke left behind in hydrocarbon production. As a result, our catalysts decrease carbon dioxide emissions from oil refinement by 28%,\u201d says Associate Professor Huang. The implications of this research are highly significant for the hydrocarbon industry and highlight the potential for a \u2018catalyst industry\u2019 in Australia. \u201cDenmark for example, has created an entire industry exporting ammonia to hydrocarbon manufacturers across the globe. Our catalysts, developed in Australia, provide a more cost-effective and sustainable solution that is in high demand,\u201d says Associate Professor Huang. The combustion of hydrocarbon fuels still emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, creating the need for alternative energy sources in the future. However, as researchers look to solar, wind and water for energy, hydrocarbon is still utilised in sustainable technologies, as well as everyday household items, such as plastics and pharmaceuticals. Associate Professor Huang\u2019s article on this research, \u2018 Br\u00f8nsted acid sites based on penta-coordinated aluminum species \u2019, was published in the Nature Communications journal late last year. He is now working on establishing patents for new catalysts and collaborating with two international and local companies to scale-up the processes with the ultimate aim to establish a competitive catalyst industry in Australia. His efforts were recently commended with a Vice Chancellor Award, recognising his outstanding research in catalysis engineering.

            "By the time Sam Woods had completed his Bachelor of Project Management in 2014, the 23-year-old had already started working within the engineering consultancy industry with leading company SMEC Australia (SMEC). Amongst the first cohort of students to graduate from the program, Sam \u2018s undergraduate degree had provided him with the essential skills needed to understand the dynamics of how projects are scoped, delivered and managed. He put these transferable skills to good use on a number of projects as part of SMEC\u2019s energy and sustainability team. Yet the idea of exploring what else was out there professionally led Sam to pursue a career in financial services, via a postgraduate detour to the Business School where he completed his Master of Management. Sam is now part of the Business Transformation team at Westpac Group, which focuses on internal transformation projects designed to support the business\u2019 vision of becoming one of the world\u2019s great service companies, helping its customers and communities prosper and grow. We spoke to Sam about his passion for project management, his career transition and how he sees the role of project managers continuing to evolve over the coming years. Why did you decide to study a Bachelor of Project Management?. I wasn\u2019t quite sure which direction to take in terms of a career when I finished high school. What I did know was that I had a passion for working with people, and the specific focus on this really stood out to me when I was reviewing the the Bachelor of Project Management degree at the University of Sydney. What do you remember enjoying the most during your degree?. Definitely the opportunity to work on collaborative university\u2013industry projects with various organisations. This was such a unique experience; entire subjects were devoted to helping organisations find solutions to the real problems they were facing. Frequently, the deliverables from these subjects were presented to very senior audiences; to get that kind of exposure at such an early stage of your career development is incredible. What do you enjoy most about your current role at Westpac Group?. I have a passion for working and collaborating with others and at Westpac Group, I\u2019m very lucky to be in a heavily cooperative and innovative team. Over the past 200 years the company has fostered a fantastic culture that supports both professional and personal development, and experiencing this has been a real highlight. One of the standout points of the project management degree is how it helps you understand what it\u2019s like to lead and work in a team environment. This skillset has really helped with aligning myself to a completely new industry and company. What has been the most pivotal moment or choice made during your career to date?. Transitioning from the engineering sector to the financial sector was a big career move for me and it involved undertaking further study. I was enjoying my time with SMEC Australia, helping to provide project management support and deliver insights to clients, but I knew I wanted to explore opportunities in other industries. To help me understand which area I wanted to focus my career on, I decided to continue my development by studying a Master of Management \u2013 again at the University of Sydney. My postgraduate studies reaffirmed my interest in strategy, innovation and business transformation and late last year I was fortunate enough to join the Westpac Group and have an opportunity to be more involved in this space. What advice would you give to a young person considering studying project management?. Immerse yourself in the learning opportunities provided to you both in and outside the classroom. Any opportunities that involve presentations by industry professionals are so valuable and should not be missed. They are more than happy to pass on their knowledge to you and answer whatever questions you have about becoming a project manager or project specialist. How do you see the role and importance of project manager grow over the coming years?. There are significant changes now happening around how project managers are perceived and classified in a number of industries. Businesses are placing greater trust in young project professionals who are technically trained in project management by giving them significant responsibilities. This change is really helping to accelerate the careers and development of younger project managers, which is great to see. Traditionally, project management roles were reserved for team members who worked their way up to senior positions, but in today\u2019s market project management is being recognised as a technical skill. This is helping to create more employment and progression opportunities for graduating project management students. I also strongly believe that younger project managers are bringing innovation and enthusiasm to their roles which is helping shape the future of what project management is and providing companies with great immediate benefits. Any final thoughts you would like to share to aspiring project managers?. I highly recommend the Bachelor of Project Management at the University of Sydney to anyone interested in tertiary studies. The degree really is a fantastic mix of technical skills and soft skills that will set you apart in the business world. One of the best things about this degree is the transferability of the skillset you will acquire. Project management is highly regarded by all kinds of employers and industries and this really enhances the number of career opportunities available to students upon the completion of their studies."

            "In partnership with Engineers Without Borders Australia (EWB), 29 University of Sydney students headed to Samoa as a part of the newly-introduced Humanitarian Engineering major. This global engineering fieldwork is a core component of the major requiring students to undertake work in either a developing country or indigenous community. The two-week fieldwork provided students with opportunities to interact with a number of organisations including National University of Samoa, Samoa Land Transport Authority, Secretariate of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme, Women in Business and Development Inc. and the Australian High Commission. All of these organisations emphasise the important role played by engineers in both development and climate change adaptation. While in Apia the students also undertook a series of workshops on sustainable engineering design and critical factors for project success and failure. Students then undertook a five-day homestay in the village of Falease\u2019ela, and in small groups worked on developing eight separate projects for design challenges identified by the community. These projects, for example, required students to determine the best construction methods and materials to affordably cyclone-proof homes; explore alternative decentralised sanitation solutions to overcome current septic tank challenges; and design a new water distribution system to overcome the low pressure experienced by some households in the community. Students personally presented their findings and solutions to community members and are now in the process of providing a summary report of their engineering ideas. This will allow villagers to action the proposals via community-led projects and apply for additional funding. \u201cAs well as being able apply their engineering knowledge to the real world, students were able to immerse themselves in Samoan culture and language through food, song, dance, religion and exploration of the natural environment,\u201d says Dr Jacqueline Thomas, who oversees the major within the School of Civil Engineering. \u201cStudents were confronted with the challenges and impact of climate change currently facing Samoa and the greater Pacific area, and were tasked with creating and presenting ideas on how to address specific issues impacting the local community. \u201cThe responses from the community during the presentations were very positive and a common reflection from the students was that this had been an exciting opportunity for them to design something that would address a real-world situation. \u201cMany students started to realise the opportunities for internships and further working opportunities throughout the Pacific.\u201d. Understanding how to better serve disadvantaged communities or groups \u2013 something often overlooked by traditional engineering and technology projects \u2013 will be at the core of the Humanitarian Engineering major, the first of its kind in Australia. Humanitarian engineering addresses authentic human problems through applying diverse engineering skills to development, disaster and remote community contexts. It is about meeting the needs of communities globally, including the application of engineering processes and technology to improve water and sanitation, waste treatment, construction methods or disability access as well as provide affordable housing \u2013 all while maintaining a focus on sustainability and appropriateness. Our major provides students the crucial knowledge and skills required to plan, implement and maintain projects in rural Australian areas and developing countries. It also enables students to explore international aid and development whilst learning from experienced practitioners and industry partners on how to work in disadvantaged communities, fragile states and communities in disaster recovery."

Porsiem said her passion for physics led her to change direction, after first considering a career as an architect. \u201cTechnology is advancing as the world is developing, so I also want to contribute to this development through engineering and specifically mechatronics,\u201d she added. \u201cI am fascinated to see how the physical, man-made objects around us work through the physics theories I have learned, as well as the role played by maths in the calculation and understanding of those theories.\u201d. This is the first time Porsiem has lived and studied abroad, and she hopes also to participate in the University\u2019s Exchange Program as well as its ever-expanding industry internship initiatives. \u201cI would like to send a message to other international high school students who are considering a career like engineering but are hesitant to do so,\u201d she said. \u201cI came from Cambodia and to be able to contribute to the world\u2019s expansion through technical innovation and creation used to seem like an unachievable dream. \u201cHowever, I hope the dream will soon become a reality.\u201d."

            "When you next enjoy a refreshing glass of orange juice, consider that the peel discarded in its production may well lead to more significant health benefits including a supplement for cancer patients in remission. Bala Shammugasamy, a PhD candidate in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, is investigating the cancer preventative benefits of bioactive compounds found in citrus peel. \u201cCancer occurs when cells begin to mutate and divide uncontrollably to the point they become dangerous. However, Bala has identified that citrus extract can have a very strong \u2018cytostatic effect\u2019, meaning they can prevent these cells from multiplying,\u201d says Dr Valtchev, a postdoctoral fellow from the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering who is supervising Bala\u2019s work. Eager do something meaningful and inspiring, Bala brought his idea to Professor Fariba Dehghani, one the school\u2019s internationally-renowned researchers. Before long, Bala was quitting his job in pharmaceutical testing in Malaysia and moving to Australia to begin his journey as a PhD student at the University of Sydney. So why focus on orange peels? The healthy benefits of citrus extract can be attributed to the bioactive compounds found in citrus fruits. These compounds are most concentrated in the fruit\u2019s peel, which often goes to waste. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, oranges are the most consumed citrus fruit with 470,000 tonnes of oranges being harvested in the Australia in 2016/17. Bala\u2019s research attempts to transform this waste to useful, consumable products.",
            "Bala Shammugasamy (left) working in the lab with the research centre director, Professor Fariba Dehghani (right). \u201cBala has set up a biological screening platform to test various bioactive compounds on cancer cells and determine which compound is the most effective in keeping the cells dormant. Ultimately we want to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable this behaviour. The hope is to eventually create a supplement for people's diet that could act as a chemopreventive agent. It could even be used after chemotherapy to prevent a relapse in cancer growth,\u201d says Dr Peter Valtchev. Industry partner Defugo, a company with a patented technologies provide the capability to recover and enrich the active compounds required for Bala\u2019s research. \u201cThe product under test is a commercial product produced in an existing factory; this is a very exciting project for our company ,\u201d says Tim Lang, Chief Technical Officer at Defugo. While the screening process shows intriguing results, Dr Valtchev reminds us that the positive effects are occurring in a controlled environment where the cancer cells are in constant contact with the bioactive compounds. While the biomolecular theory is there, it is difficult to predict how these compounds will behave in the human body. Bala is hoping to complete his PhD early next year and has learned to be patient when he doesn\u2019t get the laboratory results he wants. \u201cPhD life is demanding, both mentally and physically, but it is really an interesting journey and worth the experience. I love the challenge and the work. It keeps motivated to come into the lab at 8am to do more tests and get more results. It\u2019s an exercise in resilience to stop and think about why the test is failing. But just small changes in the process and experiment design can cause a huge difference in the results,\u201d says Bala."

            "Professor Rudolf Prince challenged and encouraged us to continually improve our education and research practices to meet the needs of our industry and country. He will be missed by all of us in the faculty and the University of Sydney. Professor Prince was born in Chemnitz, Germany in 1928. He moved to Italy in 1936 with his mother and sister when the family split up. In 1938 they moved to England and then New Zealand, where he was educated at Christchurch Boys High School. He then studied chemical engineering and chemistry at Canterbury University College, graduating in 1949. While Professor Prince's career spanned the globe, he always returned to the University of Sydney. He first came to the University in 1950 as a lecturer in chemical engineering. A few years later, he travelled to the UK to work for a distiller as a process engineer in their Research and Development Department in Epsom, Surrey. He also lectured at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch and the University of Queensland, Brisbane. In 1969 he returned to the University of Sydney, this time as aprofessor and Head of Department. The two main fields that distinguished Professor Prince's influential 65-year career are distillation column design and computer simulation of chemical processes \u2013 the latter at a time when the University's only computer filled a room, required its own air-conditioning system and took an entire weekend to solve a single problem. His contribution to our student's learning experience was significant and continues to resonate throughout the curriculum today. With an understanding of the importance of experiential learning through industry, Professor Prince pioneered the University's industrial experience program, laying the foundation for today's MIPPS scheme. Professor Prince established a practice lab for first-year students. At the time female students seemed reluctant to pursue chemical engineering, thinking that their male counterparts had the advantage of growing up with more hands-on experience. In the new lab, students could see that everyone faced the same challenges, regardless of gender. Professor Prince's first-year labs not only gave more confidence to students in their early years, but also played a large role in encouraging gender diversity in the chemical engineering discipline."

The annual fun-filled event held on 13\u201314 July introduced participants to the versatility of a project management career, as explained by leading experts in the field, and required them to complete several case study projects that could only be completed by working in teams. The high school camp was rounded off by an industry site visit to enterprise software company Atlassian, where each participant witnessed firsthand how project management tied into managing the resources, people, risk and budgets associated with the myriad projects in action. \u201cProject management is such a dynamic and growing field; it was pleasing to see so many ambitious high school students attending our Winter Camp and exploring project management as a possible career choice,\u201d said Dr Kenneth Chung, Director of Project Management Undergraduate Program. \u201cThe Winter Camp itself is tailored towards developing the important transferable soft skills such as leadership, communication and team dynamics needed as a project manager in the workforce. \u201cThe site visit to Atlassian reinforced what had been taught by our experts over the two days, with students seeing for themselves the principles of people, technology and process management being applied within an industry environment.\u201d. The Winter Camp is one of 20 hands-on outreach activities offered under the Faculty of Engineering and IT\u2019s exciting Propel initiative. The Winter Camp allows high school students to learn about project management as well as programming, robotics, project management, technology and engineering \u2013 all while having lots of fun. It also serves as an introductory component of the overarching Project Management Program within the School of Civil Engineering. A career in project management can open a window of job opportunities across a wide range of industries including infrastructure, sporting and concert events, manufacturing, mining, computing, finance, law and consultancy. The Bachelor of Project Management is available at the undergraduate level while both the Master of Project Management and Master of Project Leadership is available at the postgraduate level. From 2018, a project management major will also be available via the new Bachelor of Advanced Studies for studies in Arts, Commerce, Design Computing, Economics, Science and Visual Arts."

            "The cap in question belonged to Faculty of Engineering and IT graduate Jacqueline Madsen, who was celebrating having obtained her well-earned Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Electrical) degree on 5 May. By doing so, she became the fourth generation of Madsen lineage to celebrate their graduation from the University, a tradition started in 1900 by her great-grandfather, the late Sir John Percival Vissing Madsen (1879\u20131969). Sir John Madsen, the highly regarded physicist and engineer, initially graduated from the University with a Bachelor of Science degree and the University Medal in mathematics in 1900, before completing his Bachelor of Engineering, this time with first-class honours and again the University Medal a year later. He became an academic at the University in 1909 before detouring to serve his country as the chief trainer of engineering during World War I. Upon his return in 1920, Sir John became the foundation professor of electrical engineering, now known as the School of Electrical and Information Engineering. His name is emblazoned on the heritage-listed sandstone Madsen Building located within the Camperdown campus, which is today home to the School of Geosciences. \"Electrical engineering is something that has been in the family for a long time and I'm proud of that legacy,\" says Jacqueline. \"He was very influential in starting up electrical engineering at the University and his name can be seen in many places throughout the campus including the Madsen Building, which was always pointed out to me. \"I had several physics-related lessons within the building, so I enjoyed spending time in the building myself. Additionally, the main lecture theatre within the electrical engineering building is also named after him, and is a place I spent a great deal of time throughout my degree.\". Jacqueline is now utilising her electrical engineering degree to solder her own career and is currently working as a Graduate Electrical Engineer for BHP Billiton. Based out of central Queensland, Jacqueline initially joined the multinational mining, metals and petroleum company on a student industry placement while completing her undergraduate degree, majoring in Power Engineering and including several project management subjects. The Duke of Edinburgh Gold Medal recipient is currently based onsite in a fast-paced project management team, combining her engineering and project management knowledge to create improvements and increase efficiency. \"Working within the project management team allows me the opportunity to travel the region and observe how BHP Billiton as a business functions and how best to answer problems that may arise,\" says Jacqueline. \"My role allows me the flexibility to apply the stakeholder management and communication skills learnt in my project management subjects, such as when I need to coordinate work crews across different sites, as well as the more technical skills learnt in my electrical engineering degree.\". Jacqueline is a firm believer in following passion and encouraging others to follow suit, with hers lying in efficiency and problem solving. \"I believe my great-grandfather had the same mindset and his vast array of accomplishments and deserved recognitions are testament to that.\"."

            "Abyss Solutions was founded in 2014 by three scientists and engineers from the University of Sydney. Chief Executive Officer, Dr Nasir Ahsan \u2013 an alumnus of the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR) \u2013 has a passion for deep water exploration after spending time on board the Nautilus EV (with Bob Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic) exploring the depths of the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean. Ahsan and Masood Naqshbandi [BE(Civil/Structural), BComm], whose university research was in photonics, material chemistry and optical sensor technology, started Abyss Solutions with the vision of developing novel sensors to allow greater perception underwater and enable research and exploration in the deepest part of our oceans. They were joined by Abraham Kazzaz, a civil and structural engineer with vast experience working on the design, construction management and condition assessment of high-rise residential and commercial structures, industrial buildings, telecommunications structures, railway infrastructure and water infrastructure. The team saw a large gap in the market for asset inspection and management of civil and marine infrastructure such as dams, reservoirs, ships, ports and offshore structures. \u201cWhile very expensive inspection or surveying equipment exists for deep offshore assessments, nothing of this nature is available to civil infrastructure companies, whose budgets don\u2019t afford such expensive equipment,\u201d says Naqshbandi. \u201cWe are implementing a lot of fresh research ideas to commercial problems to make this possible.\u201d. Abyss has worked on some highly challenging inspection projects where the conditions, location and size of the operations have lent themselves to Abyss\u2019 specialist technology. The inspection of the 34km Alexandra canal for Sydney Water, for example, was only achievable using Abyss\u2019 remote surface vessels, given the canal was completely inaccessible by land, air and water. \u201cIn the canal, we collected over half a million images,\u201d remarks Naqshbandi. \u201cOur algorithms were able to process that within five hours, compared to 72 man hours and with 97% accuracy.\u201d. The inspection of 230 metre-long propellers on the Australian Navy ship, HMAS Adelaide, has also been made possible using the Abyss\u2019 underwater assets. The Abyss team has high aspirations for the future. \u201cAbyss\u2019 aim is to be the most reputable asset management company in the world. We want to dominate markets in water, shipping and offshore,\u201d says Naqshbandi. \u201cIn the longer term, we want to create collaborative swarms of underwater robots that can build complex infrastructure underwater and image and survey the entire ocean floor.\u201d. Where is the robotics industry heading in coming years? Naqshbandi agrees with others in predicting the dominance of robotics and AI in industry, not only in terms of robots taking over mindless manual factory jobs but the use of AI to make menial and repetitive office work obsolete. \u201cFor most people that is scary proposition and they are worried about losing their jobs, but I think it is a good thing,\u201d says Naqshbandi. \u201cNot only will it free up humans to pursue more creative and gratifying careers and hobbies, it will also make dangerous and dirty jobs safer and cleaner. Take Abyss for example, no diver wants to dive into toxic waters to inspect a wall, but the robots have no complaints doing that.\u201d."

            "Ocular Robotics' products scanned and mapped the Priscilla Catacombs in Rome. Ocular Robotics designs, manufactures and markets a dynamic sensor platform capable of 3D laser scanning and high-performance camera pointing, which is simultaneously fast and accurate. To date they are the only robotics company to create a directable sensor system with these features. Their RobotEye technology can improve the operational performance and efficiency for systems that rely on sensors. This includes robotics and automation, security and surveillance, aerospace and defence, mining and resources, and precision agriculture. We might see Ocular Robotics\u2019 technology used by an airport for surveillance. If a bag, for example, is left in the airport the RobotEye camera can follow both the dropped bag and the person who left it, because of the camera\u2019s ability to move at lightning speed and track both objects as they move. QinetiQ, a global defence and security business recently released their drone protection systems at the 2017 Paris Airshow; it\u2019s a system which incorporates an Ocular Robotics thermal camera system designed to identify and track multiple drones that may pose a threat to airports, critical infrastructure and public buildings.",
            "Ocular Robotics' RobotEye technology improves operational performance and efficiency of systems using sensors. An interesting project which involved Ocular Robotics\u2019 products was the scanning and digital mapping of the Priscilla Catacombs archeological site in Rome. Using an agile robot the team was able to explore all parts of the site, scan and interpret the vision and depth data to map out the site. Ocular Robotics\u2019 CEO, Mark Bishop saw the potential for his company while working on a research project with the University\u2019s Australian Centre for Field Robotics. One issue in the project centred on robot perception and the need to develop new ways to allow robots to interact more intelligently with their environment. For example, an automated mining truck might not be able to identify the difference between a tuft of grass on the ground and a rock and would drive around the grass unnecessarily. Mark developed the technology to allow multiple sensors to point in the same direction at the same time, enabling robots to make smarter decisions by applying a level of reasoning across the data available from the sensors. \u201cOriginally my aim was to create a robotic solution for delivering timely and precise information to robotic platforms about their environment; however it soon became obvious that many applications across many sectors would benefit from the simultaneous, rapid and precise directing of sensors enabled by the RobotEye technology platform,\u201d said Mark. Ocular Robotics\u2019 technology differs to others in that they\u2019ve removed most of the mass that normally needs to be moved to direct the view of the sensor. In other technologies changing the direction of view of a sensor would require you to move the sensor, one of the motors and their supporting structure, which are heavy and therefore reduces precision. Amazingly, the RobotEye is several times faster than the fastest saccadic movements of the human eye. So what\u2019s the future of Ocular Robotics in Mark\u2019s eyes? \u201cWe will continue to innovate in the core RobotEye technology and the products we build around the technology, to bring unique capabilities to a range of sectors and applications. \u201cI see some strong parallels between Ocular and other Australian companies like Cochlear and ResMed, who have been able to continue to innovate around a core capability over a long period of time, remaining market leaders in their sectors while building significant businesses on a global scale. I hope that Ocular will be able to emulate the success of companies like this in its own markets.\u201d. It\u2019s an interesting time for engineers like Mark working in robotics, with technological developments charging forward and the demand for these innovations at a scale never seen before. In this new world of robotics and hyper-automation there\u2019s an ever-growing demand for mechatronic engineering experts to lead the charge."

            "Suchet Bargoti\u2019s research in field robotics and machine learning has seen him develop specialised software and algorithms which automatically analyse fruit at the individual tree level using sensors and cameras. From this, information rich crop inventories can be provided to farmers, detailing the fruit load and distribution on every tree. Farmers can then use this information to optimise their agricultural practices, for example controlling the rate of pesticide spray per-tree in order to avoid wastage. \u201cFarmers can simply set up cameras on their tractors while they\u2019re working and this system will automatically gather information about every piece of fruit. This high-resolution data can then be analysed to help the farmer decide how much fertilizer to use, which irrigation methods to prioritise and how to manage harvesting logistics,\u201d Suchet explains. \u201cFarmers no longer have to rely on manual processes, but can now leave the hard work to software to detect problems and notify them.\u201d. Suchet\u2019s work differs to other research in this field as his model applies multiple types of sensing modalities to build a crop inventory in real-time. The proposed system is applicable to many types of fruit, rather than focusing on just individual fruit, as has often been done before. While undertaking his PhD research with the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR ), Suchet worked on operations spanning a wide range of farms across Australia. The significance of the work was clear early on, when an apple grower discovered a surprising variation in the crop yield due to data gathered by ACFR. The grower immediately took action and changed his planting strategy to address the variation. Applying robotics to agriculture not only offers benefits while the fruit is fully grown, but analysis can also be undertaken much earlier on during the flowering season, allowing the farmer to pre-sell produce based on a yield forecast. While Suchet was completing his PhD, which he submitted in February, he started working with Abyss Solutions, a robotics company that combines Remotely Operated underwater Vehicles (ROVs) with data analytics to provide a safer, easier and more accurate means to inspect and assess underwater environments like dams, ships or ports. Last year, the Abyss team worked on a project with Sydney Water to map the Alexandra canal in Sydney. They used an unmanned boat to collect image data along the river which enabled Sydney Water to identify the specific damages along the canal, rather than having to fix the entire canal. Suchet is now working full-time for Abyss as their Chief Technology Officer and is delighted to have the opportunity. \u201cAbyss is a fun, exciting and fast paced place to work at; I love it.\u201d. \u201cComing out of my PhD I wanted to keep working with technology, while also developing high-level skills like strategy and business development.\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m excited about where the future is heading in the world of robotics and machine learning to transform what was previously manual work into clever automated systems,\u201d he said."

            "David Boyd. Fleet Performance Engineer, QANTAS. Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Aeronautical) / Bachelor of Science (Mathematics and Computer Science). 'How do planes fly?' This simple question took David Boyd on the runway towards a soaring aviation career. After graduating from the University of Sydney with a degree in aeronautical engineering, David was accepted into the Summer Engineering Internship program at QANTAS. There he learned how to evaluate the performance of QANTAS planes, such as the Boeing 787-9, using in-house software. Equipped with this knowledge, David secured a position in QANTAS' development team as a Fleet Performance Engineer less than a year after graduating. Today, David is ecstatic about his role. He appreciates the challenges and dynamic environment the airline industry has to offer. \"Each day I learn something new about aircraft and airline operations, and this constant learning process is something that I really enjoy,\" says David. David attributes some of his success to his decision to change his double degree in Arts to Science, majoring on Computer Science. \"Having a Computer Science major opened up so many additional careers; a large amount of engineering roles are now asking for programing and computer science knowledge\", says David. \"Don't study something just because it has a high ATAR; pick something you will love,\" David advises prospective students. The outcome of this philosophy is certainly being played out now as David continues to fuel his career with new learnings on the job at QANTAS.",

Seeing a product through from its initial design to commercialisation and distribution is an engineer's dream come true for Michael Topham. Two years out of university, this biomedical engineering graduate is now a Product Manager at Corin where he leads a team of six. \"Managing and designing projects with my team which are implemented into our production line is definitely the most enjoyable aspect of my role,\" says Michael. Michael's career journey began early, when his peers convinced him to come along to the SUABE networking event at university. There he learned about the summer internship program at Optimized Ortho. \"I learnt that networking isn't just a buzz word, it's something that actually allows you to get to where you want to go,\" says Michael. With his foot in the door, Michael climbed the ranks and became a simulation engineer. He was responsible for processing CT scans and X-rays through kinematic simulations. In the innovative world of biomedical technology, Michael has found himself at the forefront of life-changing technologies and encourages others to do the same. \"If you are interested in software and engineering, definitely consider combining these interests with biomedical engineering. They are fun and entertaining fields to work in,\" says Michael. \"I think there will be many more opportunities for biomedical engineers to integrate software into existing infrastructure and create new tools that we haven't even thought of yet.\".",
            "Renee Noble. Software Engineer, Data 61. Bachelor of Engineering (Chemical and Biomolecular) / Bachelor of Science (Chemistry). A career in coding wasn't the plan for this chemical and biomolecular engineering student. With an aptitude for maths, chemistry, physics, biology and creative thinking, Renee Noble decided do a double degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and Science. \"The combination of Chemical Engineering and Science meant that I could study the things I enjoy, whilst having some diversity in my degree\", says Renee. \"When I got to uni, I discovered computer science and was glad I had that flexibility to add it to my science degree. I took up some computer science subjects and persevered, even though everyone else had a lot more programming experience than I did. Eventually I caught up, climbed to the top of some of the classes and now I work for Data61\u2013CSIRO because of it,\" says Renee. Renee's career is a testament to the unpredictable nature of career paths, and the importance of flexible learning initiatives such as the Flexible First Year Program. Today, Renee is thrilled with where her studies have taken her. \"I get the chance to look at real world problems and see how we can use data and algorithms to create solutions,\" says Renee. \"I'm currently designing algorithms to find better ways to match students to internships, using artificial intelligence so students and businesses get the best experience possible.\".",

Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) / Bachelor of Science (Chemistry). \"For students interested in understanding the way things work, and the improving the world around them, I would highly recommend studying a Bachelor of Civil Engineering at the University of Sydney,\" says Gavin Barnes, now a Project Manager at Lendlease, a global construction company headquartered in Sydney. \"Working in the realm of construction project management provides an opportunity to learn a great diversity of skill sets and techniques. Also, working in a team that completes shorter lifecycle projects means that new challenges are encountered and overcome regularly,\" says Gavin. Gavin was drawn to engineering as early as high school. \"I formed great interests in sciences and structures growing up. Upon leaving school, I realised that engineering would be an interesting and fulfilling career, whereby I could practice and influence these areas,\" says Gavin. With technology reshaping the way we live and interact with our physical spaces, adaptation is key for civil engineers of today. Gavin refuses to fall behind. \"Disruptive technologies are significant in our field; they challenge the traditional way of doing things. For instance with commercial fit-outs, more people are able to work from home, and organisations are shifting to meet this new way of working.\". A shift in industry calls for a new generation of engineering graduates driven by data and creativity. \"We will be needing people with evolving ideas and capability to cater for society's ever-changing needs. This will require manipulation of the vast amount of data that is available, so I see roles further complemented with use of data analytics within existing jobs,\" says Gavin.

            "Dr Daniel Wilson\u2019s interest in autonomous aircraft began during his Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Mechatronic) undergraduate degree at the University of Sydney where he built and tested a low-cost autopilot. After completing his undergraduate degree he headed back to his country of origin, New Zealand where he worked for Martin Aircraft on the flight control system for the Martin Jetpack \u2013 a manned vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) flying machine. While he was there the Martin Jetpack was featured in Time Magazine as one of the 50 Best Inventions of 2010. Realising his desire to further explore the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) he moved back to Australia and completed his PhD at Sydney University with the Australian Centre for Field Robotics. During his four years of research he demonstrated what is thought to be the world\u2019s first autonomous mid-air docking between two UAVs, also known as drones. As a result of this breakthrough, in 2016 he was named one of Engineers Australia's Top 50 Innovators in Australia. Last year he relocated to San Francisco where he is the Co-Founder/CEO of OCI Technologies, an aerospace company focused on developed autonomous solutions that extend the capability of unmanned aircraft. We spoke to Daniel about where his passion for developing UAVs came from and where he sees the aerospace industry heading in the future. What do you love most about working at OCI Technologies?. The thing I enjoy most about my job is being lucky enough to spend most of my time doing what I love. What has been a pivotal moment during your career that got you to where you are today?. An important moment was during my mechatronic undergraduate degree at Sydney University when I decided to build a low-cost autopilot UAV (drone) as my final year thesis with Dr Ali Haydar G\u00f6kto\u011fan as my supervisor. It was my first taste of UAVs and has shaped my entire career. Dr G\u00f6kto\u011fan also later became my PhD supervisor which was fantastic. What has been your greatest achievement so far?. One of the highlights of my career was being selected by Engineers Australia as one of Australia\u2019s Top 50 Innovators last year. It was the culmination of four years of postgraduate research, so it was great to recognised for all the hard work. My experience at Sydney University helped me reach that goal and they also nominated me for the award!. Can you tell us a bit about your current work at OCI Technologies?. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to be involved in some of the most cutting-edge aerospace projects, working primarily on autonomous airborne navigation systems. Has there been a change in your field that has shifted the way things are done?. There have been some gradual regulatory changes around UAV operations. These rules mostly affect commercial operators but it has impeded UAV research in the past, particularly in the USA. Previously US regulations made outdoor UAV testing very difficult. It could only occur in a handful of designated areas by certified operators. The UAV would otherwise have to be tethered or be flying in a netted area. What exciting job opportunities are on the horizon in the world of aerospace?. In the next five years I think we will see passenger-carrying autonomous electric aircraft deployed for relatively short journeys. With that we will see opportunities to design the vehicles and infrastructure. What are the next steps for you at OCI Technologies?. We will continue to seek out and work on interesting aerospace projects while simultaneously building our own product offering. In five years I\u2019d like to see the team expanded, the company sustained through our product line and a large portion of the engineering team focused on cutting-edge aerospace research."

            "At 22 years of age while studying Computer Science and Technology at the University of Sydney, Ruchir Punjabi started Langoor \u2013 a digital marketing agency \u2013 from his living room. Today, this venture is a thriving global business that spans five countries. Eight years on, Ruchir plays a pivotal role in supporting the leaders of Langoor and its group of companies. These companies include leading brands such as AlterNet in the Internet of Things world; Pensaar, a leading Design Thinking business; and Kreate Konnect, an e-commerce channel advisory business. Ruchir is also passionate about making a positive impact on people\u2019s lives. He created the Australia India Youth Dialogue, a diplomatic dialogue between the young leaders of Australia and India. He serves as Director on a number of not-for-profit and business boards \u2013 the kind of service that Ruchir got a taste for this at the University of Sydney where he was on the Board of International House and President of the University of Sydney Union. Currently, he is focusing on expanding the Langoor Group as well as setting up a few ventures with a social agenda. One such venture is creating a Graduate School of Policy and Governance in India for the developing world. We asked Ruchir about his success to date and his plans for the future. What do you enjoy most about your current role?. I\u2019m working across a range of organisations and projects right now besides my primary role as Chairperson of Langoor. I like the diversity of work and the ability to go in and out of respective pieces of work as required. What has been your greatest achievement to date \u2013 something that you are really proud of? What helped you to reach that goal?. To be honest, I am not quite satisfied with what I have done so far. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t regret anything and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of being involved with some wonderful things, but I continue to want to learn and push the boundaries on how I can improve the human race and move it forward. At 30, I feel there is a lot to be done. Where do you see the digital marketing industry headed over the next five years?. I think there are going to be a range of speciality areas in digital marketing including augmented reality, virtual reality, data and analytics, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence as well as applications for non-conventional screens. These are all exciting areas and will offer some amazing opportunities for engineers and IT professionals to get involved with. People who can connect the dots and pull together a range of these areas will be in high demand. How does your company differ from its competitors?. Langoor is a digital agency of 200+ creative technologists. These days a lot of our competitors are specialists in the services they offer. However, for the brands we work with, we believe the real edge comes from balancing insight, data, creativity and technology with experience. This means understanding their business goals and helping them achieve those holistically. That\u2019s not easy to do with multiple specialists and this is what helps us to stand out. With operations across Asia Pacific, we also appeal to organisations that want to reach these diverse markets. There are not many companies that have the perspective and experience that we do across this region. Lastly, we have a setup where we leverage skills and learnings across borders. We end up with an inherent competitive advantage because of how we can apply our learnings from different markets. Can you describe an average day for you?. I'm actually a Non-Executive Chair in Langoor. This means my time in Langoor usually goes in solving problems that directly support the CEO including strategy, fundraising, PR and some new business development. This is in addition to supporting the respective leaders of AlterNet, Kreate Konnect and Pensaar. Personally, I am also working on a School of Policy and Governance (an institution) we are building in India to reimagine public policy education from a developing world perspective. I've invested in a few other start-ups. My favourite of these is one which we\u2019re building to be a publisher in the not-for-profit space in India. Given the range of my interests, there is no real structure to the day per se. Often it\u2019s also in different cities and so the intensity of the day can differ depending on where I am. Your new start-up, AlterNet is at the forefront in one of the latest emerging industries. How would you describe the Internet of Things and how do you see it being utilised by businesses in the future?. \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 (IoT) is more a buzz phrase than it is real. It is an umbrella phrase that promises a new world, but in some ways is limiting the imagination of what is possible because of how broad the idea is. What is more real is building sensors to help building managers control temperature, virtual reality games and health trackers like FitBit etc; the point I am trying to make is IoT as a term is too generic but there is some amazing innovation happening at the intersection of different areas through the connection of hardware to the Internet. Organisations are going to have to work out what they are good at and whether there are technologies they can take from other areas to help them improve. While the \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 is so broad, innovation in their particular field of expertise using hardware and the Internet can be game changing. As people and organisations continue to innovate, we are going to witness a complete reimagining of the business landscape in less than 10 years. Business models that have existed for the last 100 years are not going to exist in the next 10 through the adoption of practical IoT and Artificial Intelligence. Langoor is now a global business spanning Hong Kong, Singapore, India and Dubai. Have there been any differences in the way Langoor operates in each country?. It is quite amazing how markets react to the same technology. For example, a lack of vernacular language keyboards on phones in India has meant that many people use the WhatsApp voice messages and voice call functions. However, in Australia, most of that usage is through typing. In many parts of the Middle East, WhatsApp calling is banned. Similarly, most Indians experienced the internet for the first time on their mobile, skipping the whole desktop experience and so they use the internet more for utility (commodity prices, messaging, etc.) than for entertainment. There are many examples like these where different tools and technologies have received a stronger response in some markets in which we operate compared to others. What\u2019s next for Langoor?. As a business, we are looking to strengthen our presence in the region and consolidate our work with lesser, yet bigger clients. We will also go very deep this year on leveraging data meaningfully. Lastly, we are keen on expanding our footprint either in the UK or the USA. Many of the decisions impacting our region are made by their organisation's headquarters in these countries. Have there been pivotal moments or choices made in your career that impacted your success? What did you learn from that experience?. I think starting Langoor right out of university happened because I was at the right place at the right time. I was quite na\u00efve, to say the least, when I started out but there is no education equivalent to running your own business. Seven years along and I am less active in that business, but because of that experience, I am now quite confident walking into new areas I know nothing about. As a student, you were passionate about social change. Does this passion still resonate throughout your current projects?. Frankly, I have reduced the time I spend in Langoor partly because I am still deeply passionate about social change. There are a limited number of things I can do in Langoor that help me make a meaningful difference in the world. At the moment, the School of Policy and Governance, as well as the publishing platform for Indian not-for-profits, are the two key items that have me immensely engaged in helping move humanity forward.

            "Hands-on industry experience not only lets students get a taste of the real world before finishing university, but it also gives companies access to the brightest students who can provide a fresh perspective to business problems. This is the thinking behind the University of Sydney\u2019s 12- week industry placement required of all engineering students and is also what inspired the development of the Sydney Industry Project Placement Scholarships (SIPPS) scheme. SIPPS provides students at the top of their class the opportunity to spend six-months working full-time at a company of their choice as part of their final year of study. For the last five months four Sydney University students have been working at global professional services company Accenture in the Technology team. They work directly with Accenture clients, scoping out projects and presenting their results. One such project was for one of America\u2019s biggest retail outlets on an automated incident detection and management system across their 5000 stores. The system monitors everything in the store: products, transactions and infrastructure. Data is analysed and automatic resolutions are sent back to the company\u2019s relevant teams. Another project the students have been working on is anomaly detection and predictive forecasting. They use machine learning to identify or anticipate issues in a client\u2019s operational infrastructure. Adam Paruk, Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Mechatronic) / Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology student is loving the freedom and responsibility the placement is providing. \u201cI have the same responsibilities as a full-time employee; they don\u2019t treat me as a student but as an equal and this is by colleagues with 15 years\u2019 experience. Having the trust of others to deal with critical project decisions is definitely a confidence boost,\u201d he said. Accenture\u2019s Managing Director, Luke Higgins has found working with the students a refreshing and enlightening experience. \u201cThey have a different perspective and a great creative energy when attacking a problem. This perspective yields better results as the solution is more simplistic in its implementation. I have enjoyed working with such high-calibre students, which Sydney University Engineering is known for producing.\u201d. For SIPPS students while they undertake their placement they also work on their final year thesis and often use their industry experience as the basis for their work. Adam\u2019s thesis is on the development of a machine learning algorithm that detects unused or obsolete resources and notifies the company of the wastage, which was spurred by his work at Accenture. Fellow SIPPS student, Nicolas Dai is currently studying a Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Mechatronic) / Bachelor of Project Management. Through the program he has gained valuable professional experience which will add to his education. \u201cBefore SIPPS I hadn\u2019t had much exposure to software engineering, but over the last few months I\u2019ve gained confidence in my abilities to investigate new technologies, identify business applications and create integrated solutions.\u201d. What does Nicolas\u2019 want to gain out of the placement? \u201cBy the end of the program I hope to have built a solid set of skills and will be much more informed about the options out there after university,\u201d said Nicolas."

            "Agricure, a stock feed premix and supplement manufacturing company in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, has been working with the University since 1990. Directors, Ray Biffin and Hubert Regtop were concerned about the use of menadione, a synthetic Vitamin K supplement known as K3, which is toxic to humans but used in the feed for chickens, pigs and horses, as well as pet foods. \"Vitamin K3, we have shown, substantially decreases chicken bone density, and creates both animal welfare and commercial productivity issues\", says Mr Regtop, Research Director at Agricure. To tackle the problem, Agricure is working with researchers in the University's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering to develop chicken feed and other animal feeds fortified with natural Vitamin K1. Vitamin K1 phylloquinone occurs naturally in high concentrations in green vegetables, algae and grasses but is unstable when subjected to UV light. In high intensive poultry farming there is little natural K1 intake, particularly in battery chickens which are not able to range freely eating grass and insects. Similarly, horses fed a high-energy starch diet rather than allowed to quietly graze in paddocks, have been found to suffer bone density issues as they grow. Andrea Talbot, a PhD student in the School's ARC Food Processing Training Centre (ARCFPTC), has shown that replacing the synthetic menadione with natural Vitamin K1 makes chickens healthier and more profitable by increasing bone density, overall lifetime and egg-laying productivity. The research has enabled Agricure to secure the international patent for the stable form of Vitamin K which can be added to feed. \"We believe that this is a simple first step toward getting K1 back into the food chain,\" says Andrea, who is working for Agricure while completing her doctorate. \"Being in partnership with the ARC Food Processing Group, and the University of Sydney generally, provides Agricure with international exposure and lends academic rigor to its own research and development. The partnership has allowed Agricure to access equipment and expertise that we may lack here at the factory.\". Research team member, Tom Tarento is also developing low-cost Vitamin K1 products from microalgae and cyanobacteria \u2013 the ancient ancestors of land plants. Not only will these products be super-rich in Vitamin K1, they will contain a host of other beneficial nutrients and bioactive compounds for both human and animal health. From a consumer perspective, eggs and chickens enriched with K1 will be beneficial to increase our Vitamin K intake, being more readily absorbed and stable compared to other dietary sources. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble Vitamin that is best known for the important role it plays in blood clotting. However, Vitamin K is also absolutely essential to building strong bones, preventing heart disease, and crucial parts of other bodily processes. While we know less about the role of Vitamin K in human bone health than calcium and Vitamin D, research confirms that a Vitamin K deficiency can lead to weaker bones and an increased risk of fractures. More than 4.74 million Australians over the age of 50 have osteoporosis or poor bone health. By 2022 it's predicted that there will be one fracture every 2.9 minutes. Over the next 10 years, the total cost of osteoporosis and associated fractures is estimated to be $33.6 billion. 1. In addition to answering Agricure's brief for improving animal welfare and productivity, the Chemical and Biomolecular engineering research team is also in the process of developing low-cost Vitamin K-added products for human consumption.

            "'Trimph' (Temperature Responsive Injectable Modifiable Peptide Hydrogel) has been developed by Dr Ali Fathi from the University of Sydney and his team in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. It was the result of his cutting-edge doctoral research with Professor Fariba Dehghani in injectable hydrogels which laid the foundations for Trimph. The dynamic properties of this biomaterial are what make it revolutionary in injury treatment and prevention. At room temperature, Trimph remains a liquid that can be injected into the affected area. Once at body temperature, the gel changes its elasticity to provide the scaffolding required to aid the repair of damaged tissue. The gel then gradually dissolves into non-toxic components and is absorbed into the body. By utilising this injectable biomaterial, medical professionals can greatly decrease the need for open surgery and the associated risks when treating tissue damage. In Trimph's Sydney-based facilities Dr Fathi has now proven scalability, having validated production to provide enough product for almost 200 clinical uses per batch. Dr Fathi's research team have completed animal trials and are now a month into human trials. The early signs are very positive. \"We have shown that the Trimph is very easy to use, clinicians can save hours in the theatres by using this novel technique. Additionally, preliminary clinical results have shown that we can significantly accelerate the healing time in the body. In the end, both clinicians and patients will be satisfied with the outcome,\" said Dr Fathi.",
            "Dr Fathi has worked hard to transition this university research project into a successful start-up venture, having secured the license from the University of Sydney's Commercial Development and Industry Partnerships (CDIP) to use, commercialise and to further develop the intellectual property in a wide range of medical fields. \"CDIP supported me even before I realised it; they understood the start-up nature of Trimph and have been outstandingly encouraging. I really want to get this message out \u2013 that this commercial arm of the University of Sydney is there to support entrepreneurs. It was because of their initial support that I could incorporate the company, raise capital from private and public sources and form this business that now it employs five smart and highly skilled individuals,\" said Dr Fathi. In addition to funding from the state and federal governments, Dr Fathi's work has been lauded by Innovation and Science Australia chair Bill Ferris who told the ABC in a recent interview that Trimph \" is the sort of start-up that can affect health outcomes here and abroad.*. In December 2016 Dr Fathi received a Nobel Award for Local Technology Start-Ups at a Nobel Gala event in Sydney hosted by Cicada Innovations, one of Australia's leading incubators of emerging tech start-ups. The first of its kind in the southern hemisphere, the Nobel Gala replicated the world-renowned Nobel Award experience at Australian Technology Park. In addition to the start-up founders, guests included Federal and State Ministers, Chief Executive Officers from industry and university stakeholders. \"This night shows the university\u2013industry culture has been changed and now we can have policy makers, academics, CEOs from multinational corporates and founders of start-ups under one roof, talking about innovation, advanced technologies and manufacturing to form the future of the country,\" said Dr Fathi. Dr Fathi completed his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering in Iran. After completing his studies, he worked for the Ford Motor Company's Dagenham Plant in London as a junior mechanical engineer. Dr Fathi believed that the routine nature of this job wasn't satisfying him and so he moved to Australia to complete a Master of Professional Engineering at the University of Sydney. It was here where Dr Fathi decided to pursue the PhD which ultimately led to his ground-breaking work in polymer hydrogels. \"We have shown that Trimph is well-tolerated in the body and it can help the regeneration of bone,\" Dr Fathi states. \"It is just the beginning; to be able to register the product for public use we have a long and challenging way to go,\" said Dr Fathi. Dr Fathi founded Trimph with fellow alum Terence Abrams who completed his Bachelor in Chemical Engineering at the University of Sydney. In true start-up fashion, the pair have now transformed an old warehouse into a clean room production facility in the heart of Alexandria \u2013 something that is common in San Francisco but virtually unheard of here in Australia. From here Dr Fathi will press on with getting Trimph gel to market, perhaps continuing the same fast pace of success he has already achieved in reaching human trials. *Source: <Cicada Innovations inaugural Nobel Gala, ABC News Breakfast BF> viewed 17 May 2017."

Both achievements deservedly acknowledge his work in developing new methods for designing piled raft foundations, has helped shape and transform the skylines of cities across the globe. Poulos' methods in Dubai alone gave rise to the Burj Al Arab, the Emirates Twin Towers, and most notably the Burj Khalifa \u2013 the world's tallest building \u2013 where he and his team peer reviewed the foundation design. Poulos has also worked on such projects as the Incheon 151 Tower in South Korea, numerous residential towers in Hong Kong, and Melbourne's ever-sprawling Docklands Project. Most recently, he provided his expertise to the foundational design of the Crown Sydney tower development within Sydney's flourishing Barangaroo precinct. \"When I visit Dubai now and look at it, it's always a source of pride and achievement knowing that I had a little bit to do with that building,\" said Professor Poulos. \"I have been rather fortunate to be involved in these prominent types of buildings \u2013 it is very satisfying knowing that I had something to do with each one. \"The role in the Burj Khalifa was significant as we essentially had to verify the foundation design for the main designers who were from the UK, and with whom we collaborated closely. \"There are particular problems associated with the ground conditions there and because I had done research into those types of ground conditions, my associates and I were called upon to be involved.\".",
            "The association of the Katoomba\u2013born Poulos with the University commenced 60 years ago in 1957 as a student, when he completed both a Bachelor of Engineering (1961) and his PhD (1965) for which he focused on shallow soil foundations and research into soft soil under the tutelage of the late Professor Edward 'Ted' Davis. He soon rose through the ranks as an academic at the University, initially as a Lecturer (1965) until earning the title of Professor in 1982. This period also saw Poulos co-author two pivotal works in pile foundations alongside Davis: Elastic Solutions in Soil and Rock Mechanics, published in 1974, and Pile Foundation Analysis and Design in 1980. Poulos later transitioned into consultancy where he commenced his long tenure with the Coffey Group in 1989. This new career path saw him hold numerous leadership roles within the company as he began shaping skylines the world over. It also brought upon a number of national accolades, including being named the Australian Civil Engineer of the Year in 2003. \"The University played an important role in my development as an engineer, as it has for many others since the establishment of engineering in 1883,\" said Professor Poulos. \"I did not quite know where my studies would lead me but I am glad to have gravitated towards the area of deep foundations and to be mentored by the likes of the great Professor Davis. \"The important theoretical knowledge gained has allowed me to confront and solve different practical problems throughout my career and I have enjoyed being able to contribute to some landmark projects. \"Working with Coffey has allowed me the opportunity to collaborate with very talented engineers and to show that remarkable outcomes can be achieved when talented people collaborate.\". Poulos was ultimately awarded the title 'Emeritus Professor' by the University upon his retirement from the Faculty of Engineering in 2002. This article was updated on 10 November 2020."

For Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering student, James Zhang, the opportunity to visit the Oil Search Limited production facilities in the Southern Highlands of PNG was ideal for seeing the challenges of his thesis project firsthand. As part of the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering's Student Internships and Industry Placements (SIPS) scheme, James has been undertaking a thesis project analysing pipeline networks in Papua New Guinea to develop a risk prediction model for low operational temperatures, hydrate formation and wax formation.",
            "James spent a week in PNG analysing various pipeline networks to develop a risk prediction model as part of his thesis project. \"My industry supervisor, Andrew Hay, was eager for me to get a comprehensive understanding of the environment and terrain of the project. These conditions are one of the main causes for the dynamic variations in the process conditions which often lead to problems\", says James. James was on site for a total of six days but the days were long \u2013 6am to 6pm \u2013 with no weekends or public holidays. Most on-site operators and engineers work at these hours for 28 days straight before getting the following 28 days off. \"I spent most of the time with a senior process engineer at the production wellpads; each wellpad consists of two\u2013four wellheads which produce the oil and gas, which are then sent off through pipelines to the processing facilities\", added James. \"We travelled to around 20 of these wellpads, each with varying environmental and process fluid conditions, to examine the existing equipment and gather relevant data for my project.\".",
            "James visited the Oil Search Limited production facilities in the Southern Highlands of PNG. Oil Search Limited engineers also took time out of their busy schedules to walk James around the Agogo Processing Facility, Central Processing Facility, and Oil Search Refinery, explaining in detail the operations of various equipment and units. \"Chemical Engineers combine chemistry and engineering concepts to help solve problems related to the pollution of our environment, meeting demands for energy, and creating new materials. This unique experience has enhanced my passion for engineering and innovation, and better prepared me for working overseas and my future career.\". The SIPS program is one of its kind in Australia and has been a huge success over the years, helping students get a foot in the door at companies to secure positions after completing their degrees."

            "University of Sydney biomedical engineering student, Kristina Mahony is working with Dr Justin Bobyn to develop a new 3D-printed abdomen-powered prosthetic hand to address these critical needs. Kristina was awarded a selective Sydney Industry Project Placement Scholarship (SIPPS) \u2013 a unique combination of an honours thesis with project experience \u2013 funded by industry partner, Accenture. Supervised by Dr Bobyn, an orthopaedic registrar at Westmead Hospital, Kristina's aim is to create a low-cost mechanical prosthetic device that is more aesthetic than a traditional hook hand. \"We explored alternative methods of control to offer the user more degrees of freedom\", says Kristina. \"We wanted the hand to be able to be customised to fit so that this would increase functionality and give the recipient a deeper sense of ownership with the device.\". Traditional mechanical prosthetic arms are attached to the amputee via a harness system. When the amputee abducts their shoulder a cable on the harness is pulled and the prosthetic grip type is changed, for example from hand open to hand close. Dr Bobyn and Kristina have designed a harness system which not only compensates for shoulder movements but uses the abdomen and sides to pull different cables, resulting in a wider range of grip patterns and degrees of freedom. The added bonus will be the potential cost of the new prosthesis. \"Simple upper limb prostheses utilising a mechanical hook offer the most cost effective option. Their function is extremely limited, but they are durable. These may cost upwards of $3000. At the other end of the spectrum are myoelectric limbs with multiple degrees of freedom with a cost of tens of thousands of dollars. They are significantly less durable than their mechanical counterparts and are also limited by their reliance on battery\", says Dr Bobyn. \"We propose a limb that can be built by the user for a hundred dollars that offers the durability and dependability of contemporary mechanical limbs, with the freedom of high-end myoelectric limbs.\". Currently in prototyping stage, Kristina is working to increase the modularity of the system to allow the user to easily customise the grip patterns of the hand, as well as improve harness comfort and functionality. \"I have always had a passion for maths and science and wanted to apply these skills in a practical way \u2013 something with a strong humanitarian focus\", adds Kristina. \"Biomedical engineering at the University of Sydney has allowed me to think critically, learn about how technology works and hopefully apply these skills to improve the lives of people on a grand scale.\"."

            "To score your dream job at the age of 24 is a rare but enviable position to be in, especially when your new employer is NASA. Currently Seamus is working on two separate projects that are part of future missions into the solar system. The first is looking into how to best sterilise equipment for NASA\u2019s Ice Breaker mission to Mars, while the other has him working on inflight life-detecting biosensors as part of a mission to Encleadus, one of Saturn\u2019s moons. Enceladus has been chosen for this mission as it appears to meet the criteria needed for life to exist: liquid water, nitrogen, an energy source and organics. After completing his Bachelor of Mechanical (Biomedical) Engineering (Honours) / Bachelor of Medical Science (Pharmacology) at Sydney University in 2015, Seamus started his PhD, with his work at NASA contributing to his thesis. He is conducting clinical and laboratory research in osseointegration \u2013 a technology for lower-limb amputees where the prosthesis is connected to an implant that is anchored to the residual bone. Not someone to focus on just one or two projects, Seamus is also the founder of Vasoprint, a company that develops patient-specific 3D vascular maps through a unique algorithm that converts 2D images into ready-to-print vasculature templates. His team has recently been in talks with investors interested in acquiring their technology. We asked Seamus what a typical day at NASA looks like and what got him interested in biomedical engineering in the first place. Why did you choose to study biomedical engineering?. I have always been passionate about helping people and at the same time I love to build things, so it seemed natural that biomedical engineering was the perfect fit for me. My mother is a teacher and my father a graphic designer, so I was incredibly lucky to be surrounded by a mix of knowledge and creativity that has certainly impacted my work. What excites you and motivates you to succeed?. That\u2019s a tough one! Working on projects that can have a big impact excites me. Although these projects generally have tough problems to solve and a high chance of failure, there is nothing more fulfilling than taking on something difficult and finding a solution. Clinical research has exposed me to people suffering from diseases and this has motivated me to direct my research towards making a better life for these individuals through innovation. What is it like to work for NASA?. NASA is a dynamic and inclusive environment where I feel like I am making decisions that directly impact missions. The people who work here are incredibly passionate and driven, and it creates an atmosphere where we are all working towards one goal. I feel like I am learning new things every day, whether it be in research, product design or even project management. What does a typical day look like?. A typical day would see me working in the lab on different sensors, presenting the results to NASA scientists and engineers, and discussing how we can further their development in the context of the mission. How have you approached your time at NASA?. I believe in making the most of any opportunity that comes your way and giving 110%. NASA is a collaborative environment with common goals and I felt like my approach resonated with their goals. During my internship, I became involved with as many projects and people as possible to make the most of my time. How are you progressing with your PhD?. Although I am living in California at the NASA base, I am continuing with my PhD work through the University of Sydney. The skills I am acquiring at NASA are valuable for my research in osseointegration and have sparked some awesome research ideas and direction. My supervisors, Sydney University\u2019s Hala Zreiqat and world-renowned surgeon, Dr Munjed al Muderis are leading the world in their respective fields and shaping the future of medical innovation. They are my role models and I am honoured to be their student. It is important to finish my PhD and bring the skills I have acquired at NASA back to Australia. I see an innovative future for Australia, especially in the medical sphere and I hope I can better the lives of many who are less fortunate than myself."

            "Pictured are polymer-lipid solutions that have unique optical properties. They can undergo a colorimetric transition from blue to red in the presence of molecules, making them excellent materials for sensing a range of chemical and biological targets, such as ions, pH, gas, proteins and biomarkers in diseases. Two remarkable researchers in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Sydney have commenced their Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) and Future Fellowships this month. Dr Rona Chandrawati will be working to develop sensors for disease and contamination detection, while Professor Yuan Chen is looking to create a new generation of wearable devices and membranes from novel carbon nanomaterials. Using nanotechnology building blocks, Dr Chandrawati is designing a sensor aimed at alerting patients to early signs of cancer, as well as a system for tracking food contamination. \"Let's think of a home pregnancy test kit. We are aiming to develop a device using a similar principle to measure the presence of cancer biomarkers found in bodily fluids so that people at risk of cancer will be able to seek medical advice in the early stages of the disease. The sooner a disease is diagnosed, the more likely it is to be treated\", says Dr Chandrawati. Dr Chandrawati is also working on a kit to monitor heavy metal concentration in the body with particular application for patients who have metal-on-metal hip implants. In the future, this technology could be packaged in a convenient portable device and patients could withdraw a drop of blood at home to monitor heavy metal build up over time. Such toxicity can produce symptoms such as chronic muscle pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints, dizziness and depression, among others. Current detection techniques for heavy metal poisoning are costly, time-consuming, and require specialised equipment. There is a need to develop a test kit that is cheap, fast, and accurate. Sensors have become important tools in detecting the presence of molecules and can help us make wise decisions, such as determining whether foods are contaminated or water unsafe to drink. In terms of food safety, sensors can be developed in the form of a sticker or film that can be attached to food packaging and changes colour when the food is contaminated with bacteria or not suitable for consumption.",
            "Professor Yuan Chen. There are more than four million cases of food poisoning in Australia each year, costing $1.2 billion annually. Many of these foodborne illnesses are preventable through rapid detection of bacterial pathogens, toxins and contaminants in food and water samples. Through the development of new low-cost, easy-to-use technologies that alert consumers on food safety, this number of cases could potentially be dramatically reduced and there could be major savings in medical costs. By tracking food quality and changes in the product shelf life, food waste could be minimised and this could potentially benefit food supply chain management.'. Professor Yuan Chen's ARC Future Fellowship aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of fabric supercapacitors, wearable strain/moisture sensors and carbon membranes, moving the fundamental research of carbon nanomaterials to advanced manufacturing techniques. In the last 30 years, many exciting properties of carbon nanomaterials have been discovered. However, few studies have been able to successfully translate these exceptional nanoscale properties into practical applications. A key scientific challenge is that nanomaterials often lose their desired nanoscale properties when used as the building block of macroscopic systems.",
            "Dr Rona Chandrawati. Novel carbon structures developed in this project will find a wide usage in creating a new generation of wearable electronics, sensors and water treatment technology. Integrated into textiles, these energy storage devices may power new functions, such as sensing, therapy, navigation and communication, while preserving good wearability similar to the original fabric. Some of the technical challenges Professor Chen and his team are facing include toxicity, flame resistance, and the mechanical flexibility, stretchability and water resistance of the end product. \"Our researchers and engineers are looking towards scalable manufacturing and financial viability for the marketplace\", says Professor Chen. \"We're looking at whether these textile energy storage devices are washable for repeated use or disposable after one use.\". This project will also create fascinating research opportunities for our engineering students to advance the research frontiers in carbon science, chemical process engineering, and advanced manufacturing. \"Nanomaterials and nanotechnology are two exciting research areas opening up new possibilities for industry to help us live happier and healthier lives\", says Professor Dianne Wiley, Head of School, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. \"Professor Chen and Dr Chandrawati are at the cutting edge of these developments.\"."

            "Hazer\u2019s Managing Director, Geoff Pocock (right) and Chief Technical Officer, Andrew Cornejo (left) in the University of Sydney\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. The University's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering has teamed up with the Perth-based Hazer Group to commercialise the 'Hazer Process' for the global market. The innovative process uses cheap, readily-available natural ingredients to produce high-purity synthetic graphite and hydrogen for the clean energy and other industries, at significantly lower cost and with significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions than any existing technology. Using natural gas as a feedstock and unprocessed iron ore as a catalyst, it has the potential to become the world's cleanest and cheapest means of supplying global markets with high-quality graphite, hydrogen and clean energy. The commercialisation of the Hazer Process will give Australia's clean energy industry a clear competitive advantage and offer valuable alternatives to the export of raw primary commodities. On a global scale it has the potential to lower the costs and increase the availability of clean energy supply worldwide. Hazer Group Managing Director Geoff Pocock says the partnership will combine the two organisations' expertise and resources to fully realise the technological and commercial potential of the novel technology. \"We believe that the Hazer Process has the potential to be the most successful commercialisation of pure university research in Australia\", Mr Pocock said, \"and this commercialisation has been greatly assisted by the relationship we have built with the University of Sydney\". The opportunity to partner with Hazer Group was a perfect fit for the University of Sydney's engineers, whose research focuses on solving today's challenges and anticipating those of the future. Professor Dianne Wiley, Head of School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Sydney said, \"With global warming an ongoing challenge and worldwide demand for affordable clean energy on the rise, our partnership with Hazer Group will ensure that this pioneering technological innovation benefits the greatest possible number of people worldwide\". Graphite and hydrogen are both critical ingredients in the clean energy industry, as well as in a range of other important industries. Graphite is an essential component of batteries, among other things, including the lithium-ion batteries that power computers, mobile devices and electric vehicles. In 2013 the value of the global graphite market exceeded US$13.6 billion, with the expanding energy market rapidly driving up demand. The graphite produced by the Hazer Process is high-quality, highly crystalline synthetic graphite of high purity, which can be produced in a range of morphologies to suit specific markets and applications. The cheap, clean hydrogen produced by the Hazer Process can also be used in a wide range of existing and emerging applications, both within the clean energy market and in large-scale industrial processing. The global hydrogen market is currently valued at more than US$100 billion and, by lowering the costs and environmental impacts of production, the Hazer Process could see it grow. \"We're excited about the potential for this partnership to revolutionise the global market for clean energy and other clean technologies\", said Professor Wiley."

            "Based in Sydney's leafy north-west, 360 Knee Systems (360KS) focuses on improving patient outcomes for total knee replacements. Using pre-operative patient profiling and customised 3D surgical plans, the 360KS team works with each orthopaedic surgeon to ensure the accurate and precise placement of the prosthetics. Post-surgery the patient is then monitored using wearable sensors linked to a data analytics platform to ensure that their recovery is targeted and measured. Since 2003, the number of knee replacement procedures undertaken in Australia each year has increased by 101.5% to almost 58,000 1. With the majority of these patients over 55 and Australia's ever-aging population, it's a growing local market. Miles and business partner Bede O'Connor, however, have distribution in the much-larger US market on their agenda. \"The population demographics and market drivers in the USA are not dissimilar to those in the Australian joint replacement market\", says Miles. \"And given that the US market accounts for over half the world's total joint replacement sales, it's the obvious place to take our technology and make it succeed.\".",
            "This is not the pair's first experience in taking technology to a global audience. Their first start-up together, Optimized Ortho set the model for providing surgeons with dynamic, functional and patient-specific solutions for both hip and knee replacements. The company now has teams in the United Kingdom and the USA as well as Sydney and exports to every major market in the world. Having sold Optimized Ortho to UK company, Corin in November 2014, Miles and O'Connor were ready to take on a new challenge. \"It's a gutsy move to leave the comfort and financial security of big business to go out on your own\", says O'Connor. Both he and Miles put the funds earmarked as a deposit on their respective new homes into starting up 360KS, a move which initially received mixed reactions from their wives. The duo believe that their complementary skillsets \u2013 Miles in research and development and O'Connor in sales, marketing and logistics \u2013 is what has contributed to their success to date. \"The future of the Australian biomedical engineering industry relies heavily on research and development and process innovation. This is where the industry is focusing its attention. The reality is that traditional manufacturing skills can be accessed more economically in Asia.\" says Miles. If he had enrolled in biomedical engineering at the University of Sydney this year, Miles would certainly have many more classmates, the majority of them young women. Biomedical is the fastest growing branch of engineering, with young women making up 55% of 2017-commencing students compared with 10\u201330% for other engineering disciplines."

While the students are contributing under different programs, they will both work on autonomous system projects for quadrotors, also known as drones. They will look into ways to improve how drones fly, navigate and maneuver around obstacles. Benjamin Morrell\u2019s work at JPL will feed into his PhD thesis on simultaneous localisation and mapping for unmanned aerial vehicles. This focuses on the way drones can use landmarks to orientate themselves and map areas to plan a safe pathway. His PhD work to date in 3D mapping and path planning will be used by JPL to help the quadrotors work faster and more efficiently. This kind of research could be used in a disaster zone, allowing a drone to map out the damaged area and find injured people. \u201cJLP is the ultimate place for an Australian to work if you\u2019re interested in space\u201d, Ben said. \u201cThey\u2019re innovative, move at a fast pace and push the boundaries of technology in order to extend what we know about science.\u201d. \u201cAt JPL I\u2019ll get the chance to work with the people who drive Mars Rovers and the people sending spacecraft to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and beyond \u2013 it\u2019s going to be amazing!.",
            "Fourth-year student, Marc Rigter is finishing the last few months of his undergraduate degree at JPL as part of the Sydney Industry Project Placement Scholarship (SIPPS) program, which means his time at JPL will count towards the industry experience required of all engineering degrees, and he\u2019ll also receive a scholarship as part of his placement. Marc is looking forward to working on quadrotor technology to improve the capability and efficiency of drone navigation systems. \u201cThey make \u2018smart\u2019 decisions as they fly, maneuvering around sharp turns and navigating in areas where GPS isn\u2019t available\u201d, he said. \u201cI love working with new technology and thinking of how to apply it in new and useful ways, which is what JPL is all about.\u201d. This isn\u2019t the first time Marc has been able to apply what he\u2019s learnt through his studies in the real world; he\u2019s worked on projects like modifying autopilot programming for drones and has worked with Benjamin Morrell on trajectory planning for space robots. In second year he undertook an internship at Thomas Global Systems who specialise in avionic display systems and also completed work experience last year with NASA's Ames Research Center in San Francisco. With their go-to person at JPL a Robotics Engineer from Australia, there will at least be a few familiar faces amongst the 6000 engineers and scientist and 800 interns who innovate, explore and test their skills at this renowned research lab each year. If you\u2019re interested in all the interesting avenues space has to offer, Sydney University offers a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Aeronautical, as well a Bachelor of Engineering Honours with a space engineering major."

            "Talk to anyone with even a passing knowledge of the evolution of computer systems and they will be aware of key concepts that Professor Pratt has been instrumental in developing, and carry his name: Pratt certificates of primality, the Pratt parser and the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm that substantially streamlined the search for patterns in computer data. Professor Pratt is also well known for building what was the world's smallest webserver back in 1999, which fit into a matchbox. His remarkable work is being recognised in this year's prestigious University of Sydney Alumni Awards, where he will be awarded the Alumni Award for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The award recognises Professor Pratt's role as a forward-thinker leader in his field and celebrates his visionary thought leadership. Professor Pratt's fascination with science started early. By the age of 13 he was building radios and oscilloscopes with parts from army surplus stores. At 15 he moved onto theoretical physics, which led, eight years later, to his graduation from the University of Sydney with double honours in pure mathematics and physics. It was in the Physics Department that he discovered the emerging subject of computing, which would become a major part of his life's work. \"I found computing so extraordinarily different from the other physics departments that I fell in love with the subject,\" Professor Pratt said. \"I designed, built and demonstrated a computer that could play 'noughts and crosses' capable of only winning or drawing, although at the time I knew nothing about how real computers worked or how to program them.\". In 1976 he invented Dynamic Logic, a method of reasoning about computer programs. The richness of this idea has seen it used in linguistics and philosophy. It has had a recent resurgence in the design of high-speed digital electronics. In the early 1980s, when computer technology was rapidly evolving from a corporate and government tool into a device almost every home would eventually have, Professor Pratt helped to found one of the most influential computer companies, Sun Microsystems. In 1980 he became the unofficial faculty leader of the highly influential Sun workstation project, developing a modular computer system that gave rise to various commercial products. In 2006 he was a member of the Stanford team that created Stanley, a self-driving car that won the DARPA high-speed desert driving competition. Professor Pratt traces his current work on climate change and debunking the fallacies of climate-change denialism back to his university days. In the 1960s, he was taught about the greenhouse effect and he was unhappy to see so much of that information later ignored or misrepresented in the media. Professor Judy Kay from the School of Information Technologies sees Professor Pratt as a leading innovator in computer science with an illustrious career. \"He is an outstanding computer scientist, innovator and entrepreneur who has had a wide impact on the world through his work. He has achieved the remarkable combination of outstanding academic achievement, with research that has had wide use and huge impact in the world, and commercial success. This award recognises and celebrates these achievements,\" Kay said."

            "Biomedical engineering Dr Philip Boughton from the Faculty of Engineering is currently working with researchers from Sydney Medical School to develop a suite of technologies to better detect and assess traumatic brain injuries. Dr Boughton and a team of PhD and Masters students are developing wearable biosensors to monitor impacts. \"We're trying to build technology that can track and relay real-time data on the acceleration, deceleration and rotation of players' heads and necks. We want these biosensors to indicate not only concussive single impacts but also tell us when several smaller impacts could add up to a concussion,\" he said. \"At the moment we are in the prototype stage, however the plan is to implant this technology into a mouthguard. The hope is when a force that is likely to result in a concussion or brain injury is detected, the mouthguard will change colour or vibrate, alerting the player, training staff and referee to the injury. \"We hope that by developing a mouthguard it will be something that will become available to players at all levels of sport \u2013 from amateur through to fully professional athletes.\". The team's work forms a vital part of multi-disciplinary research into the causes, assessments and treatment of concussion in sport. Led by neuro-ophthalmologist Associate Professor Clare Fraser of the University of Sydney's Save Sight Institute and Dr Adrian Cohen, an adjunct senior lecturer at Sydney Medical School and founder of Headsafe, the research aims to prevent health effects that result in long-term harm and even death. With no accepted, singular diagnostic tool for concussion, the team is working with Randwick Rugby Union Club to validate concussion tests that will aid the development of a more accurate system to diagnose mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI). The researchers have worked with the club for the past three years, collecting data from a range of tests including XPatch accelerometers attached to players, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), cognitive tests, balance tests, salivary biomarkers and MRIs. So far this data has allowed researchers to compile baseline metrics that is improving the detection and diagnosis of concussion in players tested during and after games. Dr Cohen said the aim of the research was to develop a set of objective tests and measurements to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of concussion. \"Concussion reflects the amount of energy the brain absorbs from an impact and can be very difficult to diagnose\", he said. \"Less than 10 percent of people who suffer a concussion are knocked out and many symptoms are not apparent to those watching. We need to take the subjectivity out of it.\". Associate Professor Fraser is researching how the processing of information from the eyes can be used to diagnose concussion. She said the main issue when addressing concussion was its broad definition and underestimated danger to player health. \"Our main concerns regarding mTBI surround the lack of strong diagnostic criteria and that there are a lack of objective markers for diagnosis. Players risk serious health complications if they return to play too soon\", she said. \"They risk ongoing brain injury if they receive a second impact before recovering from the first. Players also risk long term degenerative brain diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), dementia, personality/mood changes and psychological disturbance including depression.\". The goal for the researchers is to develop a test that can accurately and objectively diagnose concussion and be used by non-medical professionals at all levels of sport with a view to preventing long-lasting damage, especially to developing brains in children and adolescents. It is believed that visual testing may prove to be the most reliable, portable and easiest to implement test in schools and amateur sports. \"Unfortunately, only professional sports teams have doctors on the sidelines\", said Associate Professor Fraser. \"We hope our research will improve the way concussion is diagnosed across all grades of sport and will make it safer for all players. In particular, we hope these tests can be used by sports trainers, coaches and teachers to guide them on when to remove a player from the field and send them for assessment and possible treatment.\". Dr Cohen said the research team wasn't trying to \"soften\" sport but make it safer for athletes and educate sports teams and the community about head injuries. \"Sport has so many positive benefits but we need to ensure players are aware of the risks they are taking. We also need to increase our understanding to give participants and their families confidence that we are looking after them throughout their careers and after they stop playing.\". Dr Cohen is also the founder of not-for-profit charity Headsafe, and is extending a global Rugby Player Health Research Project to Australia. An online questionnaire covers general and psychological health, whilst specialised visual, TMS, MRI and biomarker tests on retired Australian rugby, rugby league, AFL, equestrian and non-contact athletes will add to this important international collaboration with centres from the UK, New Zealand and Canada. Players can enroll here."

            "Graduate Mick Johnson (BSc(Hons) \u201903) is currently the CEO and co-founder of Lexy, a startup with 14 people in Sydney and San Francisco's Silicon Valley, working on one of the hardest problems in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). Mick is an entrepreneur with a track record of success. In 2010 he co-founded Whereoscope, a location-aware smartphone app that helped parents keep tabs on their children, which was sold to Facebook and Zynga. From 2012 to 2013 Mick led the mobile product team at Facebook across iOS, Android and mobile web. The key improvements to the platform helped grow Facebook's mobile usage from 430M to 945M monthly users using 7000 different types of devices. From here Mick led product development for the Search and Language team where his team grew the daily searches from 750 million to over 1.3 billion across mobile and desktop, and developed Facebook's first products in speech recognition and machine translation. Where did this success start? Mick graduated with the University Medal in Computer Science from the University of Sydney in 2002, where he was also a recipient of the Chancellor's Industry Scholarship in Engineering. In 2015 he received the Faculty of Engineering and IT\u2019s Alumni Award for International Achievement. Mick talks to us about his many challenging decisions, from the time he chose to study computer science, to passing up a job at Google to persevere with his startup, even though he'd not had a steady wage for a year. What do you enjoy most about your current role?. As a startup founder, the only hard limits on what you do are internal \u2013 you and your team can go after anything. I love the challenge of getting up every day, trying to build something that will fundamentally change the world, and knowing that we only have ourselves to blame if we fail. Why did you decide to do a degree in computing?. At the time, I wanted to work in photovoltaics. I got a scholarship (CISE) for electrical engineering and planned to do that, followed by a postgraduate degree in solar cells. However, after two years interning at power companies, I found that AI was what I found most interesting and so I switched to computer science. What do you remember enjoying most during your time at the University of Sydney?. The sense of camaraderie and fun within the faculty was pretty great. Many of my closest friends are people I met at that time, and funnily enough many of them are also in Silicon Valley these days. Have there been any pivotal moments or choices made during your career that have impacted your success or progress? What did you learn from that experience?. In 2010 I was trying to decide whether to take a job as a Google Product Manager in Tokyo, or stick with my startup and my co-founder to go through YCombinator [which provides seed funding at the earliest stages of a new venture]. I hadn't had a real salary in a year or so and the Google job looked really fun and interesting. But I couldn't let my co-founder down; I knew that if our startup succeeded the opportunity was far greater than anything I could achieve at Google. The lesson for me was that important decisions are never easy and hard choices always come up. But when you come up against a hard choice, just be thankful you are in a place to make that decision. What advice would you give to a young person considering studying engineering or IT?. Engineering and IT will be as fundamental to human life over the next few decades as the written alphabet has been until now. Knowing how to understand and control software systems will be as normal as driving cars is today \u2013 ironically an activity that will itself disappear. What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in your field of expertise in the next five years?. Programming AI technology has always been something that required computer science expertise, but as AI gets more and more mature, there will be a massive opportunity to interact with such agents without that expertise. Imagine being a landscape designer instructing a fleet of small robots on how to reconfigure a garden, or being able to customise a piece of clothing to someone's exact dimensions as they stand in front of you. The platforms to bring together specialised AI and robotic labour, such that anyone in the world can use them, still need to be built \u2013 hopefully by you!."

            "Recent research undertaken by the University of Sydney* among engineering and computing industry contacts has revealed that, together with passion and leadership, soft skills are what take a graduate to the top of their list. And soft skills develop with hands-on industry engagement as a part of their degree experience. Kosta Dunn, a third-year computing student at the University of Sydney, is looking forward to the challenge of working on a real-world industry project as a part of his computing degree. \"We get to complete a project for a business outside of the university solving their unique problems. This kind of hands-on experience is what really prepares you for a career in the computing industry,\" says Kosta. The university's strong industry connections include both larger organisations such as Atlassian and Data61/CSIRO as well as smaller startups like Digi.cash and Uprise, all of whom present challenges for the student teams to solve as part of the School of Information Technologies capstone program. Uprise CEO, Dr Jay Spence, needed an innovative way to make seeking help for work-related stress or depression more affordable and accessible. According to the Black Dog Institute and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, one in five Australians between the ages of 16 and 85 experience some form of mental illness, and 65% of people with a mental illness do not access any treatment. In response to Dr Spence's brief, the undergraduate team in the School of Information Technologies developed a chat interface to integrate with Uprise's existing stepped care intervention method. The chat interface allows psychologists to securely communicate with their patients using their own or AI-generated responses, replacing the need for a physical appointment. The work done by the student team helped Uprise obtain a grant from NSW Innovate / Jobs for NSW that will be used to fund further development of the Uprise platform. \"We were very impressed by the passion and output from the capstone team on this project. They did a fantastic job of understanding the needs we had and then running the project from start to finish,\" says Dr Spence. \"This was a team with an already high-calibre of developers whose collaboration was productive and practical. What we were left with was the prototype for artificial intelligence which became foundational in further work.\". Dr Xiuying Wang, Senior Lecturer and student supervisor in the School of Information Technologies sees the importance of capstone projects in developing both technical and soft skills required for a career in computing. \"Through their capstone project, students' professional capabilities as well as leadership, communication and interpersonal skills have been significantly improved. Some students have been offered job positions even before the completion of their project,\" says Dr Wang. All students enrolled in the Bachelor of Advanced Computing complete a capstone project in their final year, with the opportunity for research-oriented students to turn their innovative ideas into credit for a major thesis. *Pollinate qualitative research study, conducted January and February 2017, as commissioned by the University of Sydney, Faculty of Engineering and IT."

            "Former materials engineering PhD student Dr Peter Liddicoat is mapping the world one atom at a time. At the University of Sydney, the Sydney Accelerator Network (SAN: IT) gives enterprising students with dreams of Silicon Valley the exposure to innovation in the technology space. Teaming students with academics and industry practitioners, SAN: IT promotes an entrepreneurial culture that encourages and supports startup business activities. In its wake is a stream of successful businesses that each started as an innovative solution to a seemingly impossible challenge developed by Sydney engineering and computing students. Dr Peter Liddicoat, former materials engineering PhD student, is mapping the world one atom at a time. Founder and Managing Director of startup technology company ATOMNAUT, Dr Liddicoat has now taken his revolutionary Atom Microscope to Silicon Valley. As the first microscope to image every atom within materials, Dr Liddicoat's innovation utilises the next generation of technology: picotechnology (a pico is 1000 times smaller than nano!). It's the world's highest resolution 3D microscope, the data from which will enable fast and powerful computational design and open the way for more efficient solar panels, stronger building materials and faster planes. \"One of the biggest battles for a startup is getting real data on what pathways exist to bring a new technology to the world and make an impact\", says Dr Liddicoat. \"SAN: IT was instrumental in providing a platform from which I could discover and map out opportunities, and then execute them.\". Developed with the support of SAN: IT, Grok Learning is teaching the world to solve problems with code. This scalable, interactive intelligent platform supports classroom teaching and self-directed learning of computer programming and related technologies from mid-primary to tertiary students. \"For me, the main drawcard of startups truly is making a difference. It's knowing that if you didn't do this \u2013 didn't create this opportunity \u2013 it wouldn't exist. The SAN: IT program is a great way to get started, with support, mentoring and a fantastic peer group to keep you motivated!\", says Grok Learning co-founder Dr Nicky Ringland. With some 55,000 current users, Grok Learning runs courses and competitions to get students (and adults) excited about computational thinking and what it can help them achieve \u2013 anything from curing cancer and space exploration to AI-assisted language technology. In the classroom, it is also making a tangible impact for teachers. \"We had nearly two million code submissions last year. That's two million programs that we've given student feedback on. At a rough estimate of five minutes to give each student precise, targeted feedback on a solution, that's 178 years of teacher time we saved in 2016.\".",
            "PhD student Farid Mirmohseni created WipeHero. SAN: IT business founder and 23-year-old PhD student, Farid Mirmohseni has created an 'Uber for Carwashing'. WipeHero 's combination of proprietary waterless technology and online logistics platform allows them to clean cars, buses, trains, planes and more without a drop of water and on scale. \"Our technology saves over 200 litres of water wasted with every car washed\", Farid says. \"We have saved over one million litres of water. It's about saving the environment by protecting our natural resources and creating a sustainable business.\". \"The idea that you might have in your mind or on some napkin could potentially affect millions of people once it becomes a reality. Data shows there's never been a better time to start a business and, with the help of the SAN: IT program, you can immerse yourself in a world of knowledge, advice and experience to make it happen.\"."

With women representing 43% of commencing project management students and more than half of total biomedical engineering students, the University's strategies to attract women are clearly working. The good news is reflected across all faculty degrees, with a 30% growth in total female enrolments over the last four years. The University recognises the need to support and provide opportunities for women throughout their engineering and computing studies. This year more than half of the faculty's 2017 Leadership Scholarships were awarded to young women. The scholarship, designed to provide high-calibre students with leadership development and a professional experience program with some of Australia's leading firms, was offered to 18 female students from a total of 30 successful applicants (60%). Over the span of their degree, scholarship recipients will build skills in self-leadership, stakeholder and relationship management, team work and problem solving. These skills and hands-on experience were those identified as being most valuable by industry leaders in a 2017 Pollinate research study.",

The iMOVE cooperative research centre (CRC) has received a $55 million grant from the federal government. iMOVE CRC Bid Chair, Ian Murray said, \u201cAs a country, we lose around $16.5 billion a year because of congestion. When you also factor in the human and financial losses due to accidents, we are looking at a phenomenal social and economic cost. We will now have the technology and smarts available to significantly alleviate these problems. \u201cWe are at the verge of a dramatic change in the way transport will be provided in the near future. There are new disruptive technologies such as electrification, autonomous vehicles and drive- sharing that will have a significant impact,\u201d said Professor Eduardo Nebot, Director of the Australian Centre for Field Robotics. \u201cOur expertise will support the development and deployment of innovative transportation systems and the introduction of autonomous vehicles across a wide variety of industrial and urban applications. \u201cAmong the many benefits to Australia would be the productivity of its freight system from reduced congestion, fuel use and accidents. Car accidents have cost Australia an estimated $17 billion a year and the cost of congestion is projected to be $50 billion by 2030. \u201cThe University of Sydney will work with iMOVE\u2019s partners on the three main research themes of the CRC: intelligent transport systems and infrastructure, end-to-end freight solutions and enhanced personal mobility. The iMOVE CRC has been in development for over 18 months and is strongly supported by industry, technology innovators, state road authorities, federal and state government departments and industry associations. The CRC funding and ten-year timeframe will enable the 46 partners to develop technology outcomes that will benefit the whole of Australia. It will deliver new innovative options and experiences for individual travellers, much-needed productivity improvements in logistics and access to new markets for business. The iMOVE CRC will play a role alongside other national bodies in assisting states, territories and peak industry bodies to collaborate and deliver cohesive national transport outcomes. \u201cThe current explosion of data, the computing power of mobile phones, and the increasing automation of vehicles creates a vast range of opportunities to improve the range, safety, convenience and effectiveness of peoples\u2019 travel options,\u201d said bid lead for iMOVE Ian Christensen."

            "Landing a spacecraft on a comet travelling 100,000 kilometres per hour was no easy feat. It took the European Space Agency\u2019s Rosetta spacecraft 10 years to reach Comet-67P, after travelling 6 billion kilometres through the solar system. When the probe finally landed on the comet it bounced several times before getting stuck against a cliff wall, potentially ending the lander\u2019s part of the mission. Rosetta then continued to orbit Comet-67P for a further two years, making more than 21,000 scientific observations. The mission has been universally declared the most difficult and complex interplanetary exploration mission and spacecraft challenge since the Apollo 11 Moon landing. This ambitious project was made possible by the work of the University of Sydney\u2019s new Executive Director of Space Engineering, Warwick Holmes, who gave the final \u2018go-for-launch\u2019 when Rosetta shot into space in 2004. Mr Holmes\u2019 role as an Avionic Systems Engineer with the European Space Agency (ESA) saw him help to build, test and launch the spacecraft. What was once thought impossible was made possible through the work of some clever engineering, which is even more impressive when you consider the potential discoveries about life the mission may offer.",
            "As the comet had not been exposed to the heat of our inner solar system it was a close representation of Earth before human life began, as it had preserved the undisturbed chemistry of our early solar system 4.5 billion years ago. Once the probe landed on the comet, testing hoped to confirm how water first reached Earth at a time when our planet was molten rock. \u201cWe believe many comets hit Earth and carried organic chemistry, such as amino acids, which helped to make life itself,\u201d Mr Holmes said. \u201cBy matching the comet\u2019s chemical makeup with the Earth\u2019s, it should tell us more about the formation of our planet.\u201d. The good news is that water and exotic organic chemistry have already been confirmed on the comet, however it will take up to 30 years to analyse and quantify all the data. Mr Holmes\u2019 passion for space started in 1969 when as a seven-year-old he watched Neil Armstrong land on the moon. In the early 1980s he pursued his passions by completing a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical) and then a Bachelor of Science at the University of Sydney. He then took an unpaid internship with the British Aerospace Company over the summer of 1985, just to get closer to his dream of working in space.",
            "Comet-67P (image courtesy of European Space Agency). With the mammoth Rosetta mission under his belt Mr Holmes decided to head back home \u2013 not only back to Australia but to his intellectual home, the University of Sydney. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a better place to continue my career in space, back where it all began at the university,\u201d said Mr Holmes. \u201cMy 30-year career in the European space industry building 10 successful ESA spacecraft with 37 tons in orbit was only possible thanks to my two undergraduate degrees from Sydney Uni, which was the groundwork for everything that came afterwards.\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be home and I\u2019m excited about enhancing the university\u2019s space engineering programs, creating industry collaborations and putting the university even larger on the map for space engineering.\u201d. \u201cAustralia is in a fantastic position to contribute directly to developments in the space industry and Sydney University is in such a strong place to lead that charge.\u201d."

The demands for wireless technologies that can carry big data in a reliable and secure way continues to grow. Professor Vucetic is working on developing a theoretical framework and advanced signal processing and network protocols for mmWave systems, a higher frequency band which could lead to next revolution in wireless communications. In the global telecommunication industry women account for less than 40% of the workforce, however Professor Vucetic believes greater gender parity is essential. \u201cResearch has revealed that companies with a gender-diverse workforce are better able to innovate and outperform competition. To address this we need more programs by companies, universities and governments which attract and promote female talent in STEMM, and in particular telecommunications. \u201cIn the future many jobs in administration, manufacturing and mining will be lost to automation, however there will be a growing demand for STEMM skills.

Millions of people around the world suffer bone loss due to injury, infection, disease or abnormal skeletal development, and treatment often requires the regeneration of new bone. As each patient has a limited amount of bone available for grafting, the demand for synthetic bone substitutes is high. Through her biomedical engineering research, Professor Hala Zreiqat has developed a unique ceramic material that acts as a scaffold for the body to use to regenerate new bone and which gradually degrades as it is replaced by natural bone. The bone substitute resembles the architecture, strength and porosity of natural bone. It\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of a person and contains pores that allow blood and nutrients to flow through. With a long list of fellowships, awards and accolades, Professor Zreiqat is an inspiring female engineer who is passionate about attracting women to STEMM. Professor Zreiqat believes we need a greater number of women in key leadership and policy roles. \u201cI would like to see more women on boards contributing to STEMM decisions. I would also like to see greater public recognition of women for their outstanding achievements. \u201cI am a strong believer in mentoring at all levels.

The nine-week engagement program was devised by the faculty to offer students insights into the work life of a professional engineer, while gaining valuable practical experience that contributes to their coursework. Students were required to follow the correct industry practices while working on their projects, including creating a code-of-conduct, following the legal recruitment process for labour hire and invoicing for their services. \"The program has provided me with vital industry experience and has helped further develop my leadership skills in team situations,\" said fifth-year Bachelor of Engineering Honours / Bachelor of Science undergraduate Harry Chapman, whose group presented an alternative housing model through low-rise energy-efficient modular apartments. \"Being able to work with students from other areas of the faculty also provided exposure to new ways of approaching solutions which will benefit my career.\". The program was overseen by experienced engineering professional John Phillips, who had been engaged by the faculty to serve as General Manager of Operations. Several experienced tutors provided mentoring support to the students and line management assistance during the project. \"The students were keen to engage and understand the issues concerning the complex problem they had to solve and worked well as a team to develop their recommended solution,\" said Mr Philip Ratcliffe, Business Relationship Manager at Tata Consultancy Services, who sought solutions from students on an improved national broadband network approval system. \"The students clearly understood the complexities of the proposed problem and delivered in their final presentation report a viable solution, as well as other recommendations. I would recommend any and all of the participants, who were enthusiastic, engaged and positive.\". Mr Keiran Passmore, Manager Education, Professional Industry and External Engagement from the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies, believes the pilot-program was beneficial in preparing students to become industry-ready for potential employers upon graduation. \"The program was designed to prepare and equip students with the key skills required when entering the workplace environment after study,\" said Mr Passmore. \"Working effectively within a professional group dynamic and liaising with clients to solve real-life challenges has helped students to hone their communication and technical skills. It's these skills which companies look for when hiring graduates.\". \"We are grateful to these organisations as their support throughout these nine weeks has been invaluable to our students' learning and professional development. I'm confident that our industry partners have seen some high-calibre, work-ready students who will add value to their business in the future.\"."

            "\"The way we're going to train this generation will be fundamentally different from the past. These young people will absolutely change the world because now the sky is the limit in terms of what they can do,\" says Professor Athman Bouguettaya, the Head of the School of Information Technologies. Replacing previous computing degrees, the new four-year Bachelor of Advanced Computing is arguably the most innovative IT degree in Australia offering more flexibility than ever before. \"This new degree develops and connects practical and theoretical skills across computing industries,\" says Professor David Lowe, Associate Dean (Education) in the Faculty of Engineering and IT. \"Students will learn from leaders within the many different specialties of the computing field, which is essential to acquiring the skills to meet the ever-changing innovation needs in the marketplace.\". One of the highlights of the new degree is the flexibility for students to combine their interest in computing with another passion, from music and languages to finance, food science and design. By choosing a second major from a university-wide pool of more than 100 majors, Bachelor of Advanced Computing students can add skills in disciplines such as marketing, science and health to better equip themselves for the jobs of the future. Speaking about what exciting job opportunities will become a reality in the next five years, Tinlock (Tiny) Pang from the successful Australian startup Canva can see data science being applied to many more problems in an increasing number of industries. \"Having a specialisation in other fields and combining it with programming and data science will produce innovative businesses and projects we couldn't imagine or comprehend today,\" Ms Pang says. Professor Lowe can see the university's new multidisciplinary approach producing more leaders in the IT innovation space. For example, a student who combines Software Development with Music could revolutionise sound production; by choosing Computer Science and Linguistics, they may make real-time translation a reality; or by specialising in both Computational Data Science with Genetics and Genomics, tomorrow's graduate could help fight antibiotic-resistant viruses. \"The possibilities are endless,\" says Professor Lowe. With University of Sydney graduates ranked the most employable in Australia and the fifth most sought-after by employers worldwide, students studying the Bachelor of Advanced Computing will be well-equipped to meet the challenges of these future jobs.

            "Complex, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have been proposed for many applications, including sensing, communication and quantum computing and are being developed for industry. Such developments will be crucial in upcoming years as data growth is expected to exponentially grow for industries associated with Web 2.0 data centres and Internet of Things environments, as well as the biomedical world that requires reliable photonic systems. In collaboration with physicists and engineers at CUDOS and the Australian Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology (AINST), Andri has built an integrated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) circuits controller for controlling photonic systems. Amongst the key advantages of the joint CUDOS postgraduate researcher\u2019s approach is the enabling of reliable and adaptive reconfiguration of complex PICs. The integrated circuits controller can also be used as a modular and scalable photonic controller and has capabilities to simplify power supply instruments used by scientists in and engineers in experiments. \u201cTechnology works simply by controlling conventional power supplies to a scalable manner with an intergrated controller to provide larger numbers of output channels,\u201d said Andri, currently sponsored by the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education program. His work has been published in the Journal of Applied Optics. The invention, for which a US provisional patent has been filed, is called a reconfigurable power supply channel extender device or Xpow."

            "When you think of Saudi Arabia images of a barren terrain and oil reserves come to mind; but when University of Sydney students Isaac and Grace think of Saudi Arabia they\u2019re filled with excitement and anticipation. For the next six months the students will complete a placement with Dow Saudi Arabia as part of the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\u2019s Major Industrial Project Placement Scholarship (MIPPS) scheme, which has been providing real-world learning opportunities for high-achieving students since 2000. This year 16 students, the biggest cohort to date, will be working for companies like BOC, Dow, Sydney Water, Qenos, Parkes Shire Council, Ab Mauri, Goldenfields Water County Council, Hazer Group, Oil Search Limited, Orora and Visy, within Australia and across the globe, and will get a taste of life as a professional engineer. Masters of Professional Engineering third year student, Isaac Carney has received his placement at Dow in Sadara, Saudi Arabia, where he will be working on the manufacturing of reverse osmosis membrane to improve water desalination. Isaac is awed at the opportunity to work at a plant with the size and scope of Dow and will develop his Master\u2019s thesis through the research he undertakes during his placement. \u201cThe scale of Dow\u2019s work means their projects are cutting edge. The things you get to work on can only happen at a plant of that size,\u201d he said. \u201cDesalination in the Middle East is vital and anything I can do to improve the capability will be such an achievement for me.\u201d. The MIPPS program is what attracted Isaac to the Masters of Professional Engineering degree and in particular the Saudi project. \u201cBeing able to live and work in Saudi Arabia for Dow has always been a goal of mine, and was my main motivation for studying at Sydney University,\u201d he said. The MIPPS program is the only one of its kind in Australia and has been a huge success over the years, helping students get a foot in the door at companies to secure positions after completing their degrees. This year marks a turning point for the program, with Grace Henry being the first female student to receive a placement in Saudi Arabia. Grace will be based at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thuwal where she will also research reverse osmosis processes to test new water desalination technologies. Grace is currently in the fourth year of her Bachelor Engineering Honours (Chemical and Biomolecular) degree and feels nervous but excited about the experience. \u201cThis is an opportunity of a lifetime for me. As tourist visas aren\u2019t available in Saudi Arabia unless visiting family or friends, not many people experience what I will have the chance to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be fantastic to learn from Dow researchers who are world leaders in research and development. The opportunities available for female engineers are fantastic and my experience in Saudi Arabia will only add to the many avenues on offer for me after university,\u201d she said.

            "Student placements provide the opportunity to experience what life is like as a professional engineer. Finding the right company is important and the competition for positions in leading organisations is extremely high. For students in their third and fourth years, the newly created engagement project, Jacaranda Engineering Consultants (JEC), offers the perfect opportunity to gain vital industry know-how. JEC is essentially a simulated engineering consulting company where 43 students have the chance to be involved in a practical placement for nine weeks over the summer break. The program provides students with the skills to create practical solutions to real-world engineering problems which have been submitted by leading commercial engineering companies and government organisations. The Faculty has engaged experienced engineering professional John Phillips to become the CEO of JEC. A number of experienced tutors are on board to provide mentoring support to the students and line management assistance to the CEO. The program has sourced 12 industry consulting projects from six industry partners for students to work on and create tangible solutions. In addition to their mentoring role, the tutors involved act as clients, ensuring students understand the beginning-to-end client experience. Fourth year Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Civil) student Tiernan Rankin is halfway through the placement and sees the benefits already. \u201cFrom day one you are thrown into the deep end and asked to apply your skills to engineering challenges, which I\u2019ve really enjoyed. It forces you to treat this as a real job \u2013 and you can\u2019t get better industry experience than that\u201d, Rankin said. \u201cThe course is very good and far more hands-on than I initially thought. The emphasis on teamwork has significantly improved my leadership skills, time management and work prioritisation, which are crucial for any job,\u201d he added. Mr Keiran Passmore, Manager Education, Professional Industry and External Engagement from the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies, believes the program will allow the Faculty to see how this approach works in terms of exposing students to a simulated workplace environment. \u201cThe University has carefully selected key industry organisations to participate in the program to help support students learning and professional development\u201d, Mr Passmore said. \u201cThis is a wonderful opportunity to use the knowledge students have already gained from their units of study and apply these skills to real-life challenges. \u201cOur aim is to equip our students so they are ready to enter the workforce as well-rounded engineers\u201d, he added. JEC is located in the PNR Learning Hub and operates in accordance with standard commercial principles and practices, including tracking hours, code of conduct, disciplinary action and attendance. For more information regarding Jacaranda Engineering Consultants, contact the Practical Placement Program Manager Tamara Kirby."

            "In developed countries like Australia, agricultural robots, or agribots are changing the way farmers use data in large-scale farming. Data farming refers to generating, storing and analysing large volumes of data which takes the guess-work out of critical farming decision-making including optimal sowing and harvesting times. Agribots can pick apples and strawberries, herd animals, monitor lettuce health and analyse mangos to predict perfect picking times. Agricultural practices in developing countries however have a unique set of challenges with limited financial support and a steady decline in family farm labourers, as children move into the cities seeking more lucrative jobs. Professor Salah Sukkarieh and his team, including Muhammad Esa Attia from the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, have been working with local famers in Indonesia to tackle these problems. \u201cSmall to medium size farms in Indonesia, with a shrinking labour force are putting increasing pressure on family farming practices. To combat this we needed to design a more sustainable operations model, which is why the Di-Wheel agrirobot was created,\u201d Attia said. The team\u2019s aim was to develop a cost effective robot that was easy to maintain and would assist farmers in gaining more insight into the state of their crops to maximise harvest yields. The Di-Wheel robot consists of two powered wheel modules joined by an expandable central shaft. The track width can be adjusted to fit different crop widths. The flexible modular nature of the system allows it to be assembled in six minutes and easily transported.",

            "Matthew Phang Ming Hao. What attracted you to the Bachelor of Advanced Computing?. The Bachelor of Advanced Computing has provided me with the core computing content without being too restrictive in specialisations during my first year. This meant I could start the course while still deciding what to branch out into after the first few months. Which majors did you decide to elect?. I\u2019ve been sitting on the fence for a while trying to decide whether to do Computer Science or Software Engineering as a major. Because I would like to work in artificial intelligence, I\u2019ve opted for the Computer Science major as I feel it provides a better foundation for that. The best thing about the Bachelor of Advanced Computing degree is that it allows me to study a second major in an area completely different to computing. I\u2019m considering selecting either Mathematics or Music as my second major as I have a general interest in both. Despite knowing that I want to graduate and pursue a career in computer science, by doing a second major outside of this area, I can get the best of both worlds. What are some of the hands-on experiences you plan on undertaking as part of your degree?. My plan is to undertake an internship every summer at different companies, so that I\u2019m exposed to different cultures and can start applying what I\u2019m learning in my degree to real-world settings. How do you think the Bachelor of Advanced Computing will prepare you for your career?. While I don\u2019t have any set plans on what exactly within artificial intelligence I want to do, I know that the Bachelor of Advanced Computing will provide me with the core skills to succeed and a well-rounded perspective.",
            "Barbara Wang. What attracted you to the Bachelor of Advanced Computing?. I wanted to find an undergraduate degree that allowed me to create different programs to reach the broader community and help solve impossible problems. The Bachelor of Advanced Computing offers first-year students insights into the different majors available in our second year. As a high school student, I wanted to have a better understanding of each area before deciding which one to pursue. Which majors did you decide to elect?. I\u2019ve listed to enrol in the Computer Science major next year because it\u2019s an area which challenges me to reinvent all the devices I use daily. As I\u2019m studying a combined Bachelor of Advanced Computing and Bachelor of Commerce, my second major will be from the pool of majors offered by the Sydney Business School. I\u2019ve always had a passion for commerce, especially after studying economics in high school. By combining commerce with the Advanced Computing degree, I felt like I could explore a greater number and the more specialised aspects of business. What are some of the hands-on experiences you plan on undertaking as part of your degree?. I\u2019m really excited about the prospect of being involved in some upcoming hackathons which will help me improve my coding skills and introduce me to other people who have similar computing interests. How do you think the Bachelor of Advanced Computing will prepare you for your career?. The Bachelor of Advanced Computing is providing me with both the technical and soft skills required to excel in the workforce. I\u2019m planning on working in a tech company that\u2019ll enable me to think creatively while collaborating with different kinds of industries on projects which will reach millions of people."

After more than eight years as Executive Officer of the School of Civil Engineering\u2019s industry council, Malcolm Boyd \u2013 who is well known to both the academic staff and students who have passed through the School in that time \u2013 has decided to retire. Malcolm\u2019s association with Sydney University dates to the late 1960s when he completed his Bachelor of Civil Engineering followed by a Master of Engineering. In his student days, he acted as a postgraduate tutor and was actively involved in the Sydney University Rugby Club, touring California with the first-grade team in 1974.",
            "In his professional career, Malcolm is best known for the introduction of reinforced earth technology to Australia. Having served the Reinforced Earth Company in various roles from 1976 to his Chairmanship in 1999, Malcolm was responsible for the strategic direction of the Groupe TAI Company in Australia and New Zealand as well as the technical development, standards, communication and assistance for the COMTECH group. Reinforced earth technology has become a fundamental component of a civil engineer\u2019s toolkit for solving many earth retaining problems, especially in infrastructure. Amidst a busy professional life, Malcolm always found time for his voluntary commitments to the Faculty of Engineering and IT, and his connections within the School of Civil Engineering. Serving as President of the Civil Engineering Foundation from 1991\u20131997 and again in 2000\u20132002, Malcolm secured resources to ensure that the School remained at the forefront of civil engineering research and education in Australia. He served on the Dean's Industry Advisory Council for 10 years from 1996, helping to strategically develop the interaction between the Faculty, students, industry and the community, before becoming a Supervisor to the Faculty\u2019s brightest Advanced Engineering students in 2007. Acting as Chief Operating Officer and then Project Officer with the Warren Centre for Advanced Engineering from 2010 to 2015, Malcolm helped to bring industry, government and academia together to create thought leadership in engineering, technology and innovation within the Faculty. As Foundation Officer and then Executive Officer for the Council for Civil Engineering Sydney, Malcolm had an \u201cunprecedented focus, systematically enhancing the School\u2019s engagement with industry,\u201d says Professor Kim Rasmussen, Associate Dean Research, and Head of the School of Civil Engineering from 2005 to 2016. Malcolm added an industry perspective to multiple reviews of the School\u2019s educational programs and contributed richly to several accreditation interviews by Engineers Australia. He arranged seminars by leading national and international practitioners as a means of connecting students and staff to industry and drew on his network of industry contacts to help students find industry placement in their later years of study. The School expanded rapidly during his term in office, doubling in student and staff numbers, and appointed many junior academics who, being educated at foreign institutions, had few contacts with Australian industry. Malcolm played a leading role in creating a \u201cdating\u201d service for these young academics to visit and connect with practitioners to identify engineering problems in need of solution. At a time when Government is becoming increasingly focused on seeing research translated into industry practice, these connections are proving pivotal for the continued success and high rankings of the School. \u201cIf any non-staff member can be said to be \u2018 rusted on\u2019 to the Faculty and the School, it is Malcolm,\u201d says Professor Brian Uy, current Head of School of Civil Engineering. \u201cWe owe him a great debt of thanks for his service. But I suspect that, while he is retiring from his formal position, Malcolm will likely continue his service and connections to the University in other ways. We look forward to that.\"."

Research commissioned by the Faculty of Engineering and IT among industry partners, alumni, staff and students also revealed that what the market now associates with \u2018information technologies\u2019 has changed significantly since the school moved from the Faculty of Science in 2007.",
            "The school\u2019s research and teaching activities focus on algorithms, information systems, human-centred technology, biomedical technology, distributed and high-performance computing, and Artificial Intelligence. Industry and alumni respondents highlighted that \u2018information technologies\u2019 was considered much broader terminology, often associated with vocational training, and not aligned with the level of academic qualification offered by the University of Sydney. \u201cWhen we looked at the global ARWU top 20 universities, 80 percent included \u2018computing\u2019 or \u2018computer science\u2019 in their nomenclature,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to bring the School name into line with this international practice as well as our academic endeavours.\u201d. The School of Computer Science is already working to deliver new, sustainable and innovative academic programs, particularly in the postgraduate space but also as majors in the new undergraduate Advanced Computing degree. Ensuring that technology trends such as cybersecurity and the Internet of Things are further embedded into the current curriculum is a priority for the school. \u201cOur strong industry connections mean that we can keep pace with the fast-paced technology trends and equip our students to meet the ever-changing needs of employers,\u201d adds Professor Bouguettaya. The change of name heralds an exciting time for the School of Computer Science and a celebration event for staff, students, industry and alumni will be held early in the new year.

            "1. Robots boosting food security in the Pacific. An inexpensive way for small-scale farmers to increase crop yields, particularly of nutritious foods, in developing countries is on the horizon thanks to the Digital FarmHand. Engineered by the Australian Centre for Field Robotics, the robot uses low-cost, open-source technology to read crop information in real-time via a smartphone to provide an immense amount of data to the grower. Trials are currently being undertaken in Fiji and Samoa. 2. Innovative processing techniques for human milk. An underlying interest in human nutrition is the catalyst for PhD candidate Katherine Blackshaw\u2019s research into the preservation of human breast milk \u2013 the primary source of nutrition for newborn babies. Her project is investigating the viability of freeze-dried donated human milk, alternative pathogen control options and thermal treatment to preserve the immune function of milk. 3. Better ways to energise the community. Sustainable energy systems are evolving within and isolated from conventional energy systems, bringing a level of variability that must be understood. Fortunately, the research of sustainable engineer Elizabeth Tomc is helping to shed light on this area, exploring the implementation of renewable energy networks in new developments using holistic approaches that address technology, finance, ownership and governance. 4. Finally understanding housing markets. Home may be where the heart is but for many owning such an abode is simply a pipedream due to unpredictable housing markets and trends. However, there is hope for future prospective home buyers courtesy of complex systems researcher Kirill Glavatskiy. His project aims to model the behaviour of the housing market with capacity to measure, predict and mitigate systematic risks. Best of all, it intends to provide specific guidelines to economic policymakers. 5. Improving cybersecurity in the Internet of Things.

            "Tell us a little about your research. I am working to develop an ultra-low power communication strategy for Internet of Things (IoT), the network of interconnected objects that seamlessly communicate with each other. This is especially important as we move towards industrial uses for IoT such as automotive, manufacturing and industrial control. As they have been engineered predominantly for human-based communications and require frequent battery recharge, wireless communication systems can only support a short lifespan. By 2025, it is estimated there will be more than 50 billion IoT devices, the majority of which will be battery operated. The batteries are expected to operate for more than 10 years, with only one battery charge. My research aims to fundamentally change communication strategies and tailor them for the minimum energy consumptions required for many IoT applications. It involves replacing batteries with piezoelectric materials, which accumulate charge from vibrations in their environment. Our environment is a rich source of energy, including solar, mechanical and wireless energy, and has the potential to provide a limitless energy resources for these devices. I am also designing very highly-reliable and low-latency communication strategies, which is required for many industrial and mission-critical applications such as industrial control and remote surgery. For example, with a surgeon remotely operating on a patient, a communication delay of more than 1ms could lead to unnecessarily cutting a vein and potentially causing a catastrophe. My research will ensure communication delays of less than 1ms and reliable data delivery. Tell us more about the World Economic Forum. Each year, the World Economic Forum honours 50 extraordinary scientists under the age of 40 for their contributions to advancing the frontiers of science, engineering and technology. Scientists are selected from all regions of the world and from a diverse range of disciplines to engage with global researchers and to dedicate time to improving the state of the world as a member of the Young Scientists community. The Forum brings together leaders from business, government and academia to help shape global, regional and industry agendas. What does being a Young Scientist involve?. As a Young Scientist of the World Economic Forum, I am invited to two annual meetings of New Champions; I have just returned from the first of these in Tianjin and the next meeting will be in Dalian, China next year. Being a Young Scientist, I have access to all sorts of incredible forums and communities, such as the Young Scientist Community and Expert Networks, as well as several initiatives on the fourth industrial revolution to share ideas on shaping the future. The fourth industrial revolution is about riding the digital revolution that has been building since the middle of the last century. It is a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres. I meet with policy makers, public figures, political figures, great scientists and entrepreneurs from around the world.",
            "What are some of the goals of the Young Scientists Class of 2018?. The 2018 meeting of New Champions carries the theme \u2018Shaping Innovative Societies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2019, which is discussing the essential elements required for creating the innovative societies of the future. One of my research goals is to create a sustainable yet efficient communication system for Internet of Things application and services. My work is aimed to create flexible and tailored communication systems prepared for the fourth industrial revolution. The World Economic Forum offers the Young Scientists continuous support through its academic and expert networks as well as engagement opportunities with its initiatives. What does being a World Economic Forum Young Scientist mean to you?. The World Economic Forum identifies Young Scientists not solely based on their academic achievements, but according to their passion and vision to make a big impact. I am passionate about my research and the way that it will make people\u2019s lives better. It is part of my commitment to promote a healthier, more sustainable, inclusive and equitable future. I am trusted to be the next generation of science leaders from across academic disciplines and continents. Can you share with us some of your experiences in Tianjin at the annual meeting of the New Champions? What was the best aspect of the meeting?. The annual meeting was focused on developing relationships with people from wider communities outside our areas of research. These experts are committed to solving real-world problems and shaping the future of our societies. Science and technology are now evolving at a much faster pace than ever before, and I could really see these changes through the deep discussions between world leaders, political figures and scientists. The unique feature of the meeting was the diversity of sessions, discussions and forums. Everyone was passionate about making changes to improve the state of the world. What is next for you?. I am continually working with World Economic Forums in different communities and technical discussions. I actively participate in several initiatives on Internet of Things, the fourth Industrial Revolution and digital communications for communities. In 2019, I will attend the annual meeting and present a talk on my recent progress in designing future-proof communiction systems.

            "Testing equipment that can predict five years' performance in under three days. What was the project and your role? Filtration is a crucial operation in the water treatment process. I was able to design and trial a unique accelerated testing system that, in 30 days, could predict how a filter would perform for the next 50 years. I also developed a testing system that could predict day-to-day filter operation. From this, I was able to design a new and improved filter system for Shoalhaven Water and recommend directions that could be taken to prolong the filter lifespan, while adhering to the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. How will your research have real-world impact? Currently industry procedure uses a reactive approach to monitor and control filtration. My research allows for a proactive management approach by predicting short and long-term filter performance. Water utilities can now have more confidence in their operations and ability to reliably supply clean drinking water and better comply with regulatory guidelines.",
            "What was the project and your role? The aim was to investigate water quality risks in the council\u2019s rural supply network, specifically how to manage backflow at the customers' property boundary. This involved analysing current industry approaches and legislative requirements as well as undertaking risk characterisation and field verification. We carried out workshops and engaged stakeholders to design, model and assess potential program options. I took the backflow prevention program from the initial concept, through the design stage, to readiness for implementation. I also made recommendations and developed project management resources to assist the Council in integrating the program. How will your research have real-world impact? Effectively managing the Council\u2019s water quality risks across the supply network of over 12,000 consumers in regional NSW is essential to protect public health and provide safe and reliable drinking water. My benchmarking data indicates that less than half of NSW water utilities and plumbing regulators have a functional backflow prevention program. The project outcomes and approach can be scaled to similar organisations to ensure the ongoing provision of safe and reliable drinking water across NSW."

            "Dropbox's Principal Engineer James Cowling (left) graduated with a computer science degree from the University of Sydney. With over 500 million registered users across more than 180 countries, file-hosting and collaboration service Dropbox is an industry leader in cloud storage, file synchronisation, personal cloud and client software. A core component of the San Francisco-based company\u2019s success lies in its in-house storage system, dubbed \u2018Magic Pocket\u2019. Housing several exabytes of data (essentially trillions of megabytes), its genesis stemmed from the company\u2019s desire to reduce its dependence on other external parties for storage and ultimately provide a better user experience. The person charged with overseeing the software project through to completion was Dropbox\u2019s Principal Engineer, James Cowling. \u201cI got really lucky and was able to play a key role in some once-in-a-lifetime projects,\u201d says James, who graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology (Advanced ) from the School of Information Technologies in 2005. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on a variety of large projects spanning storage systems, databases and filesystems but my largest project has been leading the design and implementation of \u2018Magic Pocket\u2019. \u201cIt was a very demanding project, but a tremendous opportunity and a really gratifying experience to work closely with people I deeply respect.\u201d. Launching publicly in 2016, the project required James and his team to build a system geared to Dropbox\u2019s specific needs that could be upscaled as required, and to architect the data migration. Crucial to the design and build phase included the design of a new storage software system and storage hardware based on shingled magnetic recording (SMR) technology \u2013 a dense data recording technique in which one track on a hard drive is partly overwritten by the next, similar to the position of shingles overlapping on a roof. Dubbed \u2018Diskotech\u2019, the creation of a compact unit of storage capable of holding a petabyte (PB) of data (one quadrillion bytes) was also instrumental to the project and measured slightly longer than a standard rackmount server tray yet only 4U (18 centimetres) in a rack.",
            "'Shingled magnetic recording' technology derives its name from roof shingles. Dedicated physical storage centres were also built to house a mass-scale version of what James and his team had created, followed-up by a rigorous testing of all components. The crowning achievement of the two-and-a-half-year project though was the successful migration of data across private lines and the internet \u2013 all 500PB of it. \u201cWe not only delivered on time but were also able to achieve a significant technical undertaking without any major service disruptions or any loss of data,\u201d says James. The University of Sydney alumnus had been at Dropbox for less than a year when initially tasked lead that that \u2018once-in-a-lifetime\u2019 project. Prior to joining the technology firm, James was undertaking his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), specialising in distributed systems and consensus protocols. His doctorate was to be the final piece of the puzzle before he set out on his originally intended career path \u2013 one he ultimately did not pursue. \u201cMy original aspiration was to become a professor and move back to Australia where I would hopefully have my own research group one day,\u201d says James. \u201cThis had been my intention right up towards the end of my PhD program and my seven years at MIT. However, as I got closer to my graduation, I couldn\u2019t shake the desire to get out and build things. \u201cDropbox had a lot going for it as a company and felt like the smallest place I could find that had very large engineering challenges.\u201d. Despite this change of heart, James notes that his success abroad in part stems back to his experiences while studying within the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies. \u201cMy computer science degree served as really great preparation for my further studies abroad,\u201d says James. \u201cI received an exchange scholarship while at the University of Sydney which encouraged me to leave my comfort zone and spend a semester aboard studying in the United States. I would never be where I am now if it hadn\u2019t been forced to leave the nest and discover opportunities I hadn\u2019t previously entertained. \u201cMy Honours year at the University of Sydney also gave me a taste of research and encouraged me to pursue a PhD after graduation. I remember working in the computer labs until sunrise on countless occasions \u2013 but I had a lot of fun in the process. \u201cI also had some really supportive professors who served as personal mentors and inspired me to pursue further education in the field.\u201d."

Australia\u2019s first undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering \u2013 the Bachelor of Engineering Mechanical (Biomedical) \u2013 was launched the year after Professor Ruys joined the University. But its foundations were built on the strong research program in the School of Aeronautical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering that decade, growing out of Materials research which drove the move into biomaterials and Rheology which led to soft tissue biomechanics research. It was this rapid rise of biomaterials research that led to Andrew Ruys\u2019 recruitment as a prestigious Sydney University U2000 Fellow, undertaking research on ZTA nanocomposites and functionally-graded biomaterials. He was awarded an ARC Queen Elizabeth II Senior Research Fellowship and led both the Biomaterials Research group and the School\u2019s biomedical engineering program from 2003. Ruys became Director of Biomedical Engineering (Education) Faculty-wide and co-director of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology (BMET) in 2010. Two years later, he was promoted to Professor \u2013 the School\u2019s first in Biomedical Engineering. During his three decades of research excellence in biomaterials and tissue engineering, Professor Ruys has been responsible for a number of world firsts in research including the development of a spinal disk prosthesis that mimics the structure of the spinal disk, the discovery of the gas exudation mechanism in sintered HAp bioceramics, and the publication of the seminal paper on silicon-doped hydroxyapatite bioceramics for enhanced bioactivity, which is now a key paradigm in bioactivity enhancement. More than academic achievement, Professor Ruys has had a profound impact on the student community during his time at the University, fostering links with industry and facilitating the internship and graduate opportunities that have underpinned the program\u2019s success. Wanting to create an \u2018esprit de corps\u2019 around biomedical engineering, Ruys founded the student society, Sydney University Association of Biomedical Engineers ( SUABE ) in 2004 and implemented its lunchtime industry seminar program where students could network with visiting industry speakers and their employers. \u2018I am very proud of SUABE,\u2019 says Professor Ruys. \u2018It\u2019s now Australia's largest student\u2013industry body in the biomedical engineering field with over 250 students, alumni and industry guests at their biannual events.\u2019. Ruys\u2019 passion for connecting students with industry continued with the uniquely named and operated \u2018Magical Mystery Tour\u2019. The tour bus, complete with its namesake Beatles signage, was an on-the-road class for his third-year Biomedical Design and Technology students visiting biomedical companies each week of semester 2 for several years until the ever-growing class numbers made it impractical. No doubt Ruys\u2019 innovative approach to education has contributed to the growth of the undergraduate degree at Sydney. When he was appointed Senior lecturer in 2003, there were only 15 enrolments. By 2008, Biomedical Engineering had achieved the highest first-year enrolment of any course in the Faculty with 74 students. Today the degree has almost 10 times that number of students enrolled\u2013 half of these being young women \u2013 and the course spans four Schools encompassing mechanical, mechatronic, electrical and chemical engineering as well as information technologies. \u2018Andrew Ruys has been an instrumental part of our Biomedical Engineering program for the past three decades, guiding it very ably through an astonishing period of growth. His ability to connect research outcomes, industry engagement and a focus on the student experience has made this a truly comprehensive program that is training our next generation of Biomedical Engineers and preparing them for careers in an area of high growth,\u2019 says Professor Stefan Williams, Head of the School of Aeronautical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering. Much of the success of our current biomedical engineering program and the lateral-mindedness and creativity of those he has taught can be tributed to Andrew\u2019s example: his calm open-ended style of mentorship, his vision, practical lead and support in innovation, collegial approach with other disciplines, and strategic linking with clinicians and industry experts,\u2019 says Dr Philip Boughton, the current Biomedical Engineering Program Manager who was also one of Professor Ruys\u2019 PhD students. \u2018I see a bright future for Sydney University\u2019s Biomedical Engineering program,\u2019 says Ruys. \u2018It is the fastest growing branch of engineering today and a priority area for the University. As an Honorary Professor I look forward to assisting in its future success.\u2019."

            "Professor of Robotics, Salah Sukkarieh and his team of engineers from the Australian Centre of Field Robotics (ACFR) have undertaken trials in Fiji and Samoa using the low-cost robot, Digital Farmhand, to provide an inexpensive way for small-scale farmers to increase crop yields, particularly nutritious foods. Digital Farmhand uses smartphone technology to assess plant health, and smart tools to conduct spraying and weed control, perform crop analytics and automate simple farming tasks. An ageing farming population, a decline in available labour and the lack of real-time crop intelligence are realities for the agricultural industry in rural Australia and many of its neighbouring countries, and these issues have increasingly led to low productivity and crop losses. In Fiji and Samoa, for example, subsistence farmers are experiencing major food shortages and need to find cost-efficient, low-maintenance solutions to increase food production, lower costs and improve quality. Farmers in the Pacific region face numerous production constraints, a lack of information about crop health and management, challenges in communication and coordination (resulting in variable availability of produce in markets) as well as environmental challenges. Simple techniques such as soil testing and analysis are rarely undertaken, and farming is almost non-existent during the monsoon season when weed growth is prolific. Interestingly, many of the challenges faced by overseas farmers are similar to those experienced by Australian small-scale, rural and remote farmers. The team at ACFR sought to further understand these problems and provide a low-cost solution to bring farming in the Pacific regions into the digital age.",
            "How does Digital Farmhand work?.",
            "Digital Farmhand\u2019s modular design is based on the use of low-cost sensors and computing and manufacturing techniques that allow farmers to easily maintain and change the platform to suit their needs. Like a tractor, Digital Farmhand uses a hitch mechanism which allows the attachment of various implements like a seeder, sprayer and weeder. As many of the farms are located in remote areas, the robot is easy to maintain and uses basic manufacturing techniques enabling it to be repaired locally with off-the-shelf parts. \u201cDigital farmhand has the potential to help farmers by providing valuable information about soil and crop health, and management. It also has the potential to undertake traditionally labour-intensive activities such as weeding to reduce seasonal impacts on farming,\u201d says Professor Sukkarieh. The platform combines smartphone technologies, machine learning and low-cost robotics to provide an economical solution for farmers. The robot\u2019s sensing technology and computation technology reads crop information in real-time via a smartphone and provides an immense amount of data to the grower. For example, data processed on the phone itself can identify a type of pest or fungus that might be on the plant, signalling to Digital Farmhand to spray the correct type of fungicide. This innovation allows farmers to use readily-available technology and low-cost robotics to bring them into the future.",

            "",
            "Bringing emerging technologies to the Pacific.",
            "Not without its challenges, a core aim of the current Digital Farmhand trials is to find solutions that meet the requirements of a particular region and the level of technology available to those farmers. In partnership with DFAT and AECOM, the team at ACFR is also looking at the education and training support for the Digital Farmhand system to demonstrate to farmers how the technology could be used to improve food quality and nutrition.",
            "\u201cA further benefit to the people of the Pacific offered by Digital Farmhand is the opportunity to expose, involve and educate people in emerging technologies such as robotics and programming. Access to such learning will not only support Pacific farmers as they try to compete with international producers in their local markets, it will expose the population to otherwise difficult-to-access technology and promote local innovation and development,\u201d Melissa says See more examples of how we\u2019re developing smarter technology and partnering with industry to create a healthier, more sustainable future here.

            "No-one could explain to me why, in my 50s, I was profoundly deaf. My hearing had started to deteriorate in my early 40s and while my mother had bi-lateral cochlear implants (CIs), I was told the condition was not necessarily hereditary. Even with hearing aids, speech became increasingly difficult for me to understand, but even more so when there was background noise. I could comprehend less than 50% of speech with my right ear and almost nothing with my left ear, which was frustrating not only for me but for family, friends and work colleagues. As my hearing deteriorated, I wondered if my 30+ years\u2019 technical knowledge as an Electrical Engineer in the telecommunications industry and my personal experience of hearing disability might provide new insights into the challenges facing CI recipients. Motivated by a desire to make a real difference, I started a PhD research degree in 2014 and then later transferred to the University of Sydney under the supervision of Professor Gregg Suaning \u2013 a global leader in implantable bionics \u2013 and Dr Brett Swanson, a research scientist at Cochlear. Receiving my own CI in my left ear earlier this year has been a life-changing experience. My hearing has significantly improved, and the concentration required to understand speech has dramatically reduced. People with CIs often learn to understand 90% or more of speech in ideal conditions. With background noise or multiple people speaking, speech perception is much worse. I\u2019m experiencing these challenges first-hand as I learn to hear again with my left ear. Restaurants, family gatherings and business meetings have all been challenging to navigate.",
            "Sound processor improvements, that might make speech clearer, are typically tested by playing recorded sentences to experienced implant recipients under a range of test conditions. The recipients repeat the sentence and a score, determined by the accuracy of the repetition, is assigned. Alternatively, a mathematical model (or metric) could be used to predict speech intelligibility. With this approach, sound processing improvement ideas could be evaluated by computer simulation and then the most promising ideas tested with recipients. The metric could possibly be used to optimally configure an implant for an individual. The problem is that, while many such metrics have been proposed over the years, few of them have been specifically designed for CIs. My research is investigating a metric called \u201cOutput Signal to Noise Ratio\u201d (OSNR) and how well this predicts speech intelligibility for CI recipients. In a typical listening situation, people hear speech and background noise such as chatter or traffic noise. We call the ratio of speech to noise the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). When a CI recipient\u2019s sound processor converts sound to nerve stimulation waveforms, the SNR that is heard by the recipient is changed. The idea of the metric is that the recipient\u2019s level of speech understanding will be determined by the SNR that they actually hear \u2013 the OSNR. To date, I\u2019ve shown that OSNR is an accurate predictor in many situations, including more complex scenarios where other metrics fail. The next step is to take existing hearing test data for one test condition, and to use OSNR to predict intelligibility under a different test conditions. If this is feasible, it will open the door for the development of CI algorithms and configurations that are optimised for an individual\u2019s hearing abilities. As an engineer I apply my technical skills to find solutions to real-life problems. My passion for biomedical engineering lies in applying sophisticated theoretical concepts to develop innovative healthcare solutions that change peoples\u2019 lives. I was asked recently if being able to hear with my CI had made a difference to my life. Before I could answer, my wife jumped in and said, \u201cit has been amazing\u201d. If my research can change the lives of people with hearing disability by improving how they understand speech, this will be even more amazing."

Beyond everyday household tasks, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is set to transform manufacturing, healthcare, transportation and energy grids. But while the consumer IoT may function using existing wireless and fixed networks, industry and critical infrastructure IIoT applications need high standards of reliability, latency and security. (Latency refers to the total delay for transfer of data following an instruction for its transfer.). \u201cEmerging smart environments and infrastructure could solve major problems facing the world today, by saving energy, reducing pollution, improving health and increasing road safety,\u201d says Professor Branka Vucetic, Director of the Centre for IoT and Telecommunications at the University of Sydney. \u201cHowever, engineers are currently unable to build the wireless networks with almost zero latency and the ultra-high reliability needed for machine-to-machine communications.\u201d. This is where Professor Vucetic and her team of 60, including postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers, are focussing their expertise. What will these ultra-reliable low latency networks mean for us as the customer?. Imagine a city-based surgeon operating via robotic tools on a patient in a remote location. The networks connecting the surgeon to the robot will be able to process very high volumes of data without discernable delay (latency) so that the surgeon senses the response of the tissue. Governments will be able to avoid large-scale power outages in the energy grids by automatically identifying faults and their location in the grid before they spread over large distances. Automated cars will be able to talk to other vehicles, roadside infrastructure, transport management systems (like traffic signals) and personal mobile devices to keep the driver safe, and alert them of traffic changes.

            "Heather Mendelsohn, Technical Solutions Engineer at BOC South Pacific, holds a Bachelor of Engineering (Chemical and Biomolecular) / Bachelor of Commerce (Economics) from the University of Sydney. Graduating in 2014, her degree was the first step in her mission to become a successful engineer, providing a foundation she has continued to build on over the past four years. Learning a thing or two along the way, Heather tells us about the experiences that are shaping her future beyond the lecture hall. Starting out in a commercial role as Assistant Product Manager, she supported the engineering and commercial growth of BOC\u2019s liquified natural gas business for just over a year before moving into a position as a Graduate Project Engineer, working on a major project to automate the special gases filling process. She has been in her current role as a Technical Solution Engineer for 17 months, supporting the tenders, design, installation and commissioning of BOC technologies for water treatment, aquaculture and mining. While Heather\u2019s degree set her up with the ability to think critically and to learn the varied technical skills she has needed at BOC, the alumna says that the real challenges for graduates are around building interpersonal skills and being both tenacious and humble. \u201cConsider what skills you want to be developing in your early career that can set you up for success, like stakeholder management, technical competence and overall business acumen,\u201d says Heather. \u201cI deliberately sought roles that provided me with a strong technical background, as these [skills] are harder to develop later in your career.\u201d. While each of her positions has taught her about business and how the industry works, Heather is also learning more about herself and how to be resilient, persistent, respectful and confident whilst building relationships. From a personal perspective, it has been when Heather has had to deal with difficult people that she has grown the most. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt that their actions are not necessarily personal, but a reflection of the situation they are in,\u201d reveals Heather. \u201cFrom a business and skills perspective, each role has helped broaden my understanding of the business, but I can recommend reading widely to help identify new ideas which add value to the company.\u201d. So, what was the key to securing three successive roles early in Heather\u2019s career? Put simply, knowing what she wanted and asking for it: \u201cIt was mostly about letting people know I was interested in a new role. Your networks advocating for you on your behalf are critical in helping you secure future opportunities,\u201d she says. As a woman in a male-dominated industry, Heather chooses to be bold but respectful, knowing her boundaries and standing up for herself and others in and out of the workplace and encourages others to do the same. She enjoys the supportive culture at BOC. Heather stresses the importance of real hands-on learning and taking advantage of every moment as a student. She recommends that students use their summers to gain work experience to build their skills, knowledge and \u2018buying power\u2019 to get a job at the end of their studies. The School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering offers the Engineering Sydney Industry Placement Scheme (ESIPS) which sees students working towards their credit points with our industry partners, gaining invaluable experience out of the classroom before they graduate. \u201cEven consider studying abroad or taking a gap year to travel; no-one has ever regretted travelling the globe,\u201d Heather adds. \u201cThe persistence, patience and self-drive required in a 9-to-5 job is very different from the flexibility of being a student.\u201d. Her success at university was based on getting high marks for assignments. Now her focus is on coming to work with a positive attitude, working hard every day whilst keeping an eye on the bigger picture, and reminding herself how her work is strategically aligned to the goals of BOC. Heather is seeing job opportunities move away from the traditional pillars of metallurgy, oil and gas, and increasingly towards food processing and water treatment. This is something that the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies has already recognised and from 2019, two new majors will be added to their Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Chemical and Biomolecular) degree. The Water and Environmental Treatment Processes major explores emerging technologies in water purification and resource recovery, while learning how to solve water and waste-treatment issues affecting key industries. Process Intensification looks at how we can make industrial processes cleaner, more energy efficient and more productive. For people like Heather who are wanting to aim high in sectors such as chemical, environmental, energy, food and water engineering, a chemical and biomolecular specialisation combines collaborative learning and research with hands-on industry experience to enable you to meet the challenges faced in these fields."

            "Drone technology has made huge advances over the last decade, but the industry has struggled to fill the yawning gap between military behemoths like the Northrop Grumman Triton and the small consumer quadcopters that are available for a few hundred dollars on any high street. At one end you have a billion-dollar marvel of aero-engineering that can travel 18,000km before having to refuel and at the other an airborne camera platform at best. If drone technology is to fulfil its potential to revolutionise aerial crop surveys, battlefield intelligence, disaster relief planning and a host of other fields, it must conquer this middle ground. The challenges of reconciling the conflicting imperatives for the next generation of drones are formidable. Fast drones with the capacity to spend substantial time in the air need bigger and heavier propulsion systems, reducing the potential payload, and tend to require runways or other infrastructure for launch and recovery. Teams at the University of Sydney\u2019s UAV Aeronautical Engineering Group, part of the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies, are in the vanguard of addressing these challenges, testing promising new hybrid propulsion systems and re-imagining airframe design to improve functionality. Battery power may suffice for small recreational drones, but for more heavy-duty applications that need better range and a bigger payload, they are too heavy and discharge too quickly. Similarly, traditional piston engines are too heavy and bulky for small drones.",
            "Dr Dries Verstraete 's team from the University\u2019s School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering (AMME) is developing what it calls a Triple Hybrid Fuel Cell system which has up to four times the endurance of current battery systems. Fuel cells coupled with a battery have a number of significant advantages over both standard electric systems and piston engines: they have a better power to weight ratio, they run on hydrogen and produce no pollution, and they produce a much-reduced heat signature, a key concern for military applications. But fuel cells quickly degrade if they are asked to handle rapid fluctuations in power demand. The Sydney team has added an ultracapacitor to the fuel cell/battery combination, which smoothes out the load, giving significantly better engine life. Dr Verstraete says that the basic engineering problems have largely been solved, and that the team is now working on optimisation, particularly on the power electronics needed to tune the system for particular missions. But the AMME team are looking beyond propulsion to re-engineer the shape of drones of the future. This involves solving a key contradiction: the drone has to have the efficiency and endurance of a fixed-wing aircraft but the easy launch of a multi-rotor aircraft. One solution developed in Sydney has been the T-wing Tail-Sitter, a design that takes off vertically before transitioning in mid-air to mimic forward, fixed-wing flight. This will allow the drone to take full advantage of the extra endurance of the hybrid motor. Soldiers looking for battlefield intelligence, farmers carrying out crop surveys, oil or electricity companies looking to check the integrity of their pipelines or distribution cables can launch and retrieve the drone in the field. Jeremy Randle, the University\u2019s Chief Remote Pilot, has recently returned from testing a system that tracks radio transmitters fitted to one of Australia\u2019s most endangered birds, the Swift Parrot. New software developed by the University has significantly simplified tracking. \u201cWe designed the electronics to track the signal and the software to optimise the flight path for the aircraft to narrow down the location of that signal,\u201d he says, but he believes that for Australia to maintain its lead in drone technology, there needs to be regulatory change. Drone pilots are currently limited to line-of-sight flight. In the example of the Swift Parrot, this means that researchers can identify their feeding grounds, but cannot follow them back to their roost in real time, leaving significant gaps in their knowledge. \u201cWhat will have to come to maximise the potential is the ability to fly beyond visual range, and that is very difficult within existing rules,\u201d he says. He points out that solving the problem of drone endurance is of little use if it cannot be fully utilised. \u201cAustralian rural properties tend to be very large, and if drones are to be commercially useful to farmers, they need to be able to fly beyond visual range.\u201d. Drone technology promises to revolutionise everything from crop management to battlefield intelligence, but before that can happen propulsion and airframe technology needs to advance to improve endurance and payload capacity. With innovations like the Triple Hybrid Fuel Cell and the T-wing, the University of Sydney looks set to lead the towards a new generation of drones that will revolutionise the lives of farmers, surveyors and soldiers."

            "Retinitis Pigmentosa is a sentence of darkness: most of the estimated 1.5 million victims worldwide either have or will go irreversibly blind before the age of 40. But a multidisciplinary research team led by Gregg Suaning, Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Sydney, has developed a new bionic eye that promises to revolutionise the lives of sufferers. RP is an incurable genetic disorder that gradually destroys the ability of the retina to convert light into electrical signals that are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. Professor Suaning and his team have developed a ceramic and platinum retinal implant that mimics the retina, converting signals from an external camera mounted on a pair of spectacles into electrical impulses that stimulate the undamaged nerves behind the retina via a radio frequency coupling implanted behind the ear. Wearers \u201csee\u201d a pattern of spots of light called phosphenes: the spots of light one sees when rubbing one\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s like a jumbotron at a sports game,\u201d says Professor Suaning. \u201cThe individual light spots come together to give a recognisable image.\u201d. The principles behind the system are similar to those used in a cochlear implant, but with the Phoenix99, the University of Sydney team is pushing the boundaries. A cochlear implant typically has less than 25 electrodes: the bionic eye has 98.",
            "Professor Suaning says that collaboration has been at the heart of his team\u2019s success. He is a leading biomedical engineer in the Faculty of Engineering and IT, but he has been working with his colleagues in the School of Information Technology to develop the software to convert the camera image, and with clinicians from Sydney Medical School, the Save Sight Institute and Westmead Hospital, creating a cluster of expertise that has pushed the technology forward. He says that the team has hit the limits of current materials technology \u2013 any more electrodes in the array and electrical interference begins to degrade the image \u2013 but he believes that Phoenix99 can be further improved. \u201cIn principle, we should be able to use a pair of cameras to give an impression of distance, with different colours indicating that objects are nearer or further away,\u201d he says. And the technology has potentially much wider applications. \u201cThis could use to give a sense of touch to people with bionic prosthetics. They could feel pressure or heat in the objects they touch. We could help people with facial paralysis; they can\u2019t feel when their eyes are getting dry they don\u2019t blink and that can lead to blindness. We could use electrode implants attached to a sensor to tell them when they need to blink.\u201d. Professor Suaning is preparing the Phoenix99 for clinical trials, but he believes the next challenge will be to scale up production. All the implants are currently hand-built in the laboratory across the corridor from his office. \u201cAustralia has an impressive record in medical technology. The pacemaker was developed here, and we were leaders in cochlear implants. But developing devices like this is expensive, if we had a commercial partner, it would be much easier,\u201d he says."

            "Facial recognition systems may be a staple of sci-fi thrillers and TV police procedurals, but in the real world they are still some way from becoming reliable enough to use either as a personal access identifier or as a security tool to pick out suspects in a crowd. Facial recognition has been significantly affected by occlusions such as scarves and sunglasses, large pose variations, heavy makeup or poor image quality. But this might be about to change. Research led by Artificial Intelligence specialist Professor Dacheng Tao in the Faculty of Engineering and IT has led to significant advances on one of the key questions facing the technology: how to improve accuracy in real-time identification without needing an exponential rise in computing power and processing time. Based in the School of Information Technologies, Professor Tao attributes his success to two central advances: the invention of video data simulation for model training which helps systems to reduce the impact of image blur in discerning the key characteristics of faces, and the introduction of a multiview learning model named Trunk-branch Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (TBE-CNN). TBE-CNN integrates information from the holistic image and multiple facial components to build up a more robust image representation that overcomes some of the challenges of pose variation and occlusions. What is more remarkable is that these improvements have not come at the cost of massive increases in data-processing power. The new multiview system uses three different images to create a facial pattern but it uses less than 1.3 times the memory and time of a single-image system. \u201cWe believe the performance can be pushed still further,\u201d he says. Although facial recognition is at heart a pattern-matching problem, it presents unique challenges, but Professor Tao believes that none of them are insurmountable. In recent work, Professor Tao\u2019s team have promoted the verification rate to 99.25% by a single deep model. In a complete facial recognition system, facial detection is an indispensable step before facial recognition and this is where Professor Tao\u2019s team has also achieved significant advances. Where standard cascade facial detection algorithms score around 60 per cent accuracy for every 1000 false positives on the Face detection Data set and Benchmark (FDDB) test, Professor Tao\u2019s system is already achieving accuracy rates greater than 97 per cent. On the more challenging WIDER FACE benchmark test, where the standard cascade systems have average precision scores of less than 14 per cent, the new algorithm scores above 76 per cent. But Professor Tao is still not satisfied. The age of mass surveillance is already with us, and Professor Tao believes that the more accurate a facial recognition system is, the less likely it is to mis-identify innocent people. The new system he has created marks a milestone on the path to a safer world."

            "Previously the Head of the School of Computer and Communications Sciences at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Professor Willy Zwaenepoel plans to continue his singular focus on excellence in recruitment, promotion and retention in his new role as Dean of Engineering at the University of Sydney. \u201cA \u2018good people above all\u2019 line of thinking has informed many of my decisions,\u201d says Professor Zwaenepoel of his time at EPFL where he recruited senior academics from prominent US universities, including a number of female academics. \u201cTo be a top 10 faculty, you need to have top 10 academics and the best students, and then create an environment for them to be productive,\u201d he says. Professor Zwaenepoel sees the growth in biotechnologies and their reliance on data analytics as one of the most exciting opportunities for the Faculty to increase its influence and research expertise. Already operating one of the largest biomedical engineering programs in the Southern Hemisphere and with the University of Sydney\u2019s strong multidisciplinary links with medical staff and academics at Westmead Hospital, the Faculty has a solid foundation on which to build its capabilities in the healthcare sector. To capitalise on the already strong educational offering, Professor Zwaenepoel is keen to ensure that computing and data analytics are central to all engineering degrees, offering a distinct point of difference in the Australian market and ensuring that students are fully prepared for the jobs of the future. Bringing with him from Switzerland two postdoctoral staff and students, Professor Zwaenepoel is also looking forward to continuing his research in operating and distributed systems here at the University. An established global leader in experimental computer science research, he is best known for his work on the Treadmarks distributed shared memory system, which was licensed to Intel and became the basis for Intel\u2019s OpenMP cluster product. He was also a key advisor to Nutanix from its creation (currently valued at US$8.8 billion) and his research led Cisco to acquire two startups, iMimic and BugBuster. Professor Zwaenepoel brings to the Faculty considerable experience in commercialisation and a wide range of international research networks including several in Silicon Valley. He has played a major role in attracting industry funding, including a Microsoft gift totalling 9 million Swiss francs (around AUD$12 million) to EPFL and ETH Zurich. \u201cThe University of Sydney\u2019s engineering and IT academics attract plaudits from around the world and I hope that under my leadership we can work together to foster collaboration and application of research ideas to real-world problems,\u201d he says."

            "While not a new concept, a circular economy is one that has increasing benefits for economic and business models, society and the environment because of the growing challenges of Australian and global waste challenges and the need to find solutions. A circular economy approach looks to reuse and recycle waste for material recovery, extending the life of products and delaying or eliminating the resulting waste. This is opposed to our predominantly linear economy in which resources are extracted, produced, distributed, consumed and then disposed of, largely in landfill. Such a model has grown increasingly problematic as waste management processes struggle to accommodate the rising amount of industrial waste. A circular economy recognises the detrimental impact of waste to the environment, and calls for government, industries and communities to embrace a whole-systems-thinking approach to resource production. New methods would focus on prolonging the usability of our resources and re-using or regenerating valuable products out of the waste. The University of Sydney\u2019s Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering researchers are developing groundbreaking solutions to meet these ever-growing waste challenges. Green cement from power production. Associate Professor Ali Abbas, a researcher in the Waste Transformation Research Hub has developed a cement blend which incorporates fly ash and carbon dioxide wastes from power plants into the cement mix. This locks in otherwise environmentally-harmful waste products which would otherwise be disposed of or distributed through the air and creates a new green building material to be used in the construction industry, prolonging the lifespan of the original by-product indefinitely.",
            "Associate Professor Ali Abbas with a sample of his 'green cement'. Weight loss vitamin K from fish-farming. At the Centre for Excellence in Advanced Food Enginomics, Dr Dale McClure is currently investigating ways to utilise wastewater left from intensive fish farming. This water is nutrient-rich, allowing microalgae to grow. Using this specialised type of algae, Dr McClure plans to produce high value compounds such as Vitamin K and the weight-loss pigment fucoxanthin. These compounds can be worth more than $10,000/kg to pharmaceutical and food industries, potentially providing Australian farmers with an entirely new source of revenue and giving value to fish farming waste.",
            "An orange a day to keep the cancer away. Bala Shammugasamy, a PhD candidate in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, is researching the cancer preventative benefits of bioactive compounds found in citrus peel. Orange peels may seem like an unlikely source of waste, but Australia alone currently produces 480,000 tonnes of oranges each year, with 50% of the fruit\u2019s weight ending up as waste after it has been juiced. Bala\u2019s research has identified that citrus extract can have a very strong \u2018cytostatic effect\u2019, meaning it can prevent cancer cells from multiplying. The aim is to create a supplement which can be used as a chemo preventative agent to inhibit a relapse in cancer growth and improve remission with chemotherapy patients. As our populations continue to grow, so too does our waste. By repurposing our waste as new products and enacting a circular economy approach within our industries, we can maximise our resources and minimise the negative impacts on the environment through effective waste management."

The individual tasked with overseeing the direction and delivery of that exciting vision is Master of Project Management graduate Yarmila Alfonzetti, who was appointed Executive Director of the organisation in 2018. The executive position is the latest career highlight for the self-confessed classical music lover, who previously held such roles as Chief Executive Officer at Sydney Youth Orchestras, and Head of Classical Music at the Sydney Opera House. \u201cPursuing a career in classical music is the only thing I have ever wanted to do or be involved in,\u201d reveals Yarmila, who originally graduated with a Bachelor of Music from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music in 1995. \u201cI am passionate about Australian arts companies being the very best and robust businesses that they can be. I also like fixing things, and some of our most precious companies are actually slightly broken and struggling. I want to be the cavalry.\u201d. Riding into action, Yarmila decided to compliment her industry experience with the core skills needed to understand and manage complex projects, the skills that would allow her to effect positive change within the arts industry. Yarmila found that the University of Sydney\u2019s Master of Project Management would give her those skills as well as the flexibility to study with her personal commitments. \u201cThere was a large online component during my time studying the project management degree which was very appealing, as it allowed me to study whilst continuing to work and raise three young children,\u201d explains Yarmila, who completed her postgraduate studies in 2005. \u201cThe Master of Project Management exposed me to new and amazing concepts, and I really loved being challenged to think in new ways when approaching projects that involved multiple moving parts, stages and phases. \u201cRunning events is such a small component of what project management actually is; the specialisation really comes into its own when there are concurrent complex activities that have various outcomes.\u201d. Yarmila now approaches any project, especially those with an intended life-cycle of more than one year, by deconstructing each down into its different phases. She has sound systems in place to address issues relating to budget forecasts, scheduling and timetables, human resources, communications plans, as well as the scope and risk of the task at hand. \u201cMy Masters of Project Management degree has been helpful throughout my career, and no doubt will help me effect positive change and growth in my role as Executive Director at State Opera of South Australia,\u201d says Yarmila. \u201cThe role is a multifaceted and difficult one as I am leading the business. But I am ready to inspire all of my stakeholders to come with me on a journey towards excellence.\u201d."

            "During his leadership of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Sydney, Professor Bird taught a generation of scientists and aeronautical engineers. He also made fundamental contributions to the study of molecular gas dynamics. He will be missed by all of us in the Faculty of Engineering and IT and the wider University community. Professor Bird graduated from the University of Sydney with first class honours in 1952 and spent a period at the Cranfield Aeronautical College in the United Kingdom before receiving his Masters in 1959 and Doctorate in 1963. At 34, Professor Bird was appointed Lawrence Hargrave Professor of Aeronautical Engineering and Head of the Department at Sydney in 1964. In this role he was tasked with building the School\u2019s reputation for excellence in teaching and research and providing aeronautical engineering graduates to government departments, RAAF, airlines and the aircraft industry, a role that continued until 1990. For over 40 years, Professor Bird worked in close collaboration with and as a consultant to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Langley, Virginia and held visiting Professorships at Imperial College London, California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the University of Manchester, the Max Plank Institute for Stormungforchung and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He was a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences, the Institution of Engineers, the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the American National Engineering Foundation. In 1990, he was awarded the NASA Distinguished Scientist Award, one of the few non-Americans to be so honoured. Professor Bird\u2019s research focused on the field of molecular gas dynamics, whereby the behaviour of gases are simulated by emulating them as individual molecules together with all their chemical and mechanical behaviour. He pioneered the Direct Molecular Simulation \u2013 Monte Carlo Method (DSMC), a gas flow simulation technique which was originally used for simulation of rarefied gas flow around re-entry vehicles but is now used for solving a large range of aerodynamic and aerospace problems. DSMC calculations have assisted in the design of vacuum systems, including those for semiconductor manufacture, and of many space vehicles and missions. With Professor Bird\u2019s development of the DSMC, and his many contributions to its evolution and advancement for more than 50 years, the scientific community now has a powerful and widely used tool for a wide range of applications. For example, the use of DSMC at NASA has been used to identify heating and aerodynamic forces encountered by the International Space Station as the Space Shuttle approached for docking. His published work, which included more than 160 articles, attracting some 8000 citations, is testament to its importance to the international research community. Professor Bird published his third and final monograph, entitled The DSMC Method, in 2013, at the age of 83. Today, work continues at NASA where DSMC is being used to predict the transitional aerodynamics and heating environment for the next manned space vehicle, the Orion capsule, along with efforts to define Mars exploration options and specific missions.",
            "In 2017, his influence on Australian society was recognised with his award of an Order of Australia for distinguished service to aeronautical engineering, particularly in the field of molecular gas dynamics, as a researcher and academic, to professional scientific organisations, and as a mentor of young scientists. \u201cProfessor Graeme A. Bird is recognised for his outstanding and meritorious service over many decades to the field of Engineering. His exemplary international reputation as a pioneer in the area of molecular gas dynamics is a legacy that lives on across many sectors of engineering,\u201d said Professor Stefan Williams, Head of the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering."

            "The University of Sydney has replaced its Bachelor of Information Technology with arguably Australia\u2019s most innovative computing course: Bachelor of Advanced Computing. People who loved coding and app development at school might also look at the Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Software) \u2013 both are four-year degrees, so what\u2019s the difference and why would you choose one over the other?. The Bachelor of Advanced Computing is a computing degree (obviously!). The focus is on the technologies that underpin our digital work and how we use these technologies to create new computing systems and solutions. It will allow you to focus in different areas of computing: underlying theories and algorithms ( computer science ); analysis and management of data ( data science ); design and management of business solutions ( information systems ); and the process of designing solutions ( software development ). What makes this degree so innovative is that you can choose a second major and increase your employment prospects while pursuing your passions in other areas. You can do a second computing major or one from a shared pool of more than 100 cross-disciplinary majors across the University. \u201cYou can combine software development with music and revolutionise sound production,\u201d says Professor David Lowe, Associate Dean \u2013 Education at the University\u2019s Faculty of Engineering. \u201cOr combine data science with genetics and genomics, and help fight antibiotic-resistant viruses. Taking a second major in business, languages or any one of the cross-disciplinary majors will add value to your resume.\u201d. If you decide to complete your studies after three years, you can complete one major and opt out of the Bachelor of Advanced Computing and graduate with a Bachelor of Computing. The Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Software) is an engineering degree rather than a computing degree. The focus is on the overall lifecycle of software solutions and the engineering contexts in which these solutions are applied. The degree is more highly structured, drawing strongly on the underlying concepts of engineering: analysis and design; development processes; project management; and integration with wider systems. Put simply, the two programs have much in common and significant overlap, but the differences have more to do with the disciplinary culture. Advanced Computing has greater flexibility and focuses on underlying technology. Software engineering has more structure and focuses on application domains. Advanced Computing is more likely to lead you to work as part of a software team, whereas Software Engineering will lead into jobs working as part of wider team where software is one part of a system. Both paths will allow you to work across a large field of industries from banking and finance, defence and retail, to healthcare and telecommunications. With Australia\u2019s number one university for graduate employability[1], you\u2019ll be in a good place to take advantage of our strong industry connections to get your dream job no matter where you go for Advanced Computing or software engineering.

Having completing his degrees, and faced with no established space program in Australia, Warwick took an unpaid internship with the British Aerospace Company in Stevenage, UK in 1985 and later progressed to become an Avionics Systems Engineer and staff member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at Noordwijk in Holland. Over a career spanning 29 years, Warwick has built 10 successful ESA spacecraft including the Rosetta mission. He spent almost five years helping build, test and launch the spacecraft which has achieved one of the most incredible results in space exploration history by successfully orbiting and deploying a lander onto a comet. Warwick\u2019s role as a team member of the Rosetta mission has had a huge impact on our knowledge and the science of comets, and has enabled scientists to prove how water got to Earth at a time when our planet was just a sterile rocky sphere.",

            "Anzac Bridge designer Ken Wheeler graduated with a civil engineering degree from the University of Sydney. Spanning 345 metres and boasting 120-metre tall diamond-shaped pylons, Sydney\u2019s Anzac Bridge proudly stands tall over Johnstons Bay connecting Glebe Island and the inner suburbs of Pyrmont and Darling Harbour. Designed and built between 1989 and 1995, the eight-lane reinforced concrete, cable-stayed bridge is the longest of its kind in Australia and serves as an integral piece of the harbour city\u2019s road infrastructure network. Its genesis, in part, can be credited to world-renowned civil engineering alumnus Ken Wheeler who headed the design team at the Roads and Traffic Authority (now Roads and Maritime Services). \u201cI felt honoured to be given the responsibility for leading the design team for a major bridge incorporating new technology,\u201d says Ken, who graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) from the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies in 1976. \u201cWe were a small group tasked with designing a new form of bridge incorporating innovative structural concepts and employing state-of-the-art methods of construction.\u201d. The Anzac Bridge had been intended to replace the existing Glebe Island Bridge, which was built in 1901 but proved inadequate in dealing with traffic flows by the 1990s. Unbeknownst to Wheeler, designing Sydney\u2019s newest bridge would not be straightforward. \u201cThe initial preferred design option was a 200m main span-balanced cantilever, concrete box girder bridge with the two main V-shaped piers in the water,\u201d explains Ken. \u201cHowever, the alignment of the bridge was close to a set of submarine high voltage electrical cables which crossed Blackwattle Bay and serviced Sydney\u2019s CBD. \u201cIt was determined that the integrity of these submarine cables was at an unacceptable risk should there be a ship collision with the main bridge piers. We decided to move the piers out of the water, lengthening the span beyond the range of a balanced cantilever bridge and into the range of a cable-stayed bridge.\u201d. As Ken and his team soon discovered, there were many challenges associated with this decision to design what would now be the first modern day cable-stayed bridge in Australia. The team then needed to incorporate new technologies such as analysis methods and stay cable technology (materials, corrosion protection, installation methods) into the mix.",
            "A bronze memorial statue of an Australian Anzac soldier holding a rifle in the \"rest on arms reverse\" drill position was placed on the western end of the Anzac Bridge in 2000. They also had to understand the learnings from what had and had not previously worked well on similar international projects, such as the effects of rain and wind vibration of the stay cables which became a real issue near the end of construction. \u201cUnder conditions of moderately light winds with coincident rain, the stay cables started to vibrate and the movement of the cables could be alarming to the bridge user,\u201d explains Ken. \u201cThis was a phenomenon only recently observed in some Japanese bridges and we needed to quickly understand the causes and how this could be controlled. \u201cNowadays this vibration can be simply controlled by adding dampers to the cables or incorporating a spiral bead on the outside of the cable ducting to drain away the rain. Both of these solutions have since been successfully incorporated on the Anzac Bridge.\u201d. Now semi-retired, Wheeler\u2019s 40-year career has seen him lead the bridge design of such prominent projects as the Bolte Bridge in Melbourne, the main spans for the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane, and the ASEAN Bridge in Sarawak, Malaysia. He also managed the construction engineering for the cable-stayed Centennial Bridge over the Panama Canal and the Phu My Bridge in Vietnam, and leading the multi-disciplined design team for Bangladesh\u2019s Padma Multipurpose Bridge, currently under construction. Ken was recently awarded Engineers Australia\u2019s 2017 John Connell Gold Medal, a prestigious accolade for structural engineers. He also helped develop the Australian Bridge Design Code AS5100 and has represented NAASRA, Austroads and Consult Australia on Standards Australia committees for steel structures, composite structures and bridge design. It\u2019s the culmination of a career that started with his decision early in life to study at the University of Sydney. Aside from his civil engineering degree, Ken also completed a Bachelor of Science in 1974 and Master of Engineering Science in 1984. \u201cAs a young boy I always had a keen interest in building things and solving problems and growing up, the University of Sydney was highly regarded for engineering, so it was there that I wanted to complete my studies,\u201d reveals Ken. \u201cTheir engineering courses provided a sound technical background to my career, for which I am grateful. Engineering qualifications from the University of Sydney are highly regarded internationally, particularly in South East Asia, and this has been of great assistance in being accepted by clients in these countries. \u201cI am pleased that there have been a number of opportunities where we have been able to recommend the University academic staff as corroborators or ask them to confirm our technical approach in specific engineering areas, such as during the detailed design of the Anzac Bridge and the Gateway Bridge.\u201d."

            "The Australian Computing Academy (ACA) is an initiative of the University of Sydney\u2019s Faculty of Engineering working with state and federal governments and industry partners to support computing in schools. ACA provides Australian teachers with educational resources and professional development necessary to deliver the new Australian Curriculum: Digital Technologies and to enable students to excel in the digital economy. This year the free in-classroom challenges will be expanded to include years 3 and 4 \u2013 that\u2019s children aged seven to nine \u2013 whose essential literacy and numeracy skills are starting to be developed, and to year 8 on the other end. Part of the academy\u2019s award-winning team helping to expand the program is Dr Nicky Ringland \u2013 entrepreneur, educator and champion for computer science and technology outreach. \u201cWhether students want to cure cancer, unlock the secrets of the universe or make the next killer app, they\u2019ll need to know how to use technology to solve problems. It\u2019s crucial to start learning those skills early,\u201d says Dr Ringland. Inspiring and empowering kids to develop their technology skills has been a career focus for Dr Ringland, who after completing her PhD in computational linguistics at the University of Sydney, co-founded Grok Learning \u2013 one of Australia's leading edutech startups. Wanting to dramatically expand the reach and impact of computer science education, Dr Ringland set about teaching tens of thousands of students each year to solve problems with technology, including over 11,000 students in one Australia-wide competition alone.",
            "Through another of her initiatives, the Girls' Programming Network, Dr Ringland mentors girls as they grow to love programming. On 22 April, more than 170 Sydney schoolgirls came together on-campus at the University to learn coding and discover the world those skills can open. The MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) game, for example, is a text-based adventure game where the girls can move from virtual room to room, pick up items and fight dragons using the characters, storylines and locations they have created themselves. \u201cCreativity is key,\u201d Ringland adds. \u201cThrough computer science you can create so many fantastic things across a vast range of fields.\u201d. Now as a Computing Education Specialist at ACA, Dr Ringland sees that upskilling teachers in the knowledge and experience of Digital Technologies in the classroom is even more important than inspiring their students after school hours. \u201cThe new Digital Technologies curriculum is a big change from existing computing education. It is much more than digital literacy,\u201d says Ringland. She believes that school leaders cannot take a \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach by only teaching word processing and spreadsheets; they need to give teachers the time, resources and support to engage with the new subject in a meaningful way. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important, not just for students\u2019 job prospects, but for Australia\u2019s economy that we get this right,\u201d says Dr Ringland. \u201cDigital technologies are set to contribute $139 billion to the Australian economy by 2020 (Deloitte/ACS) but to achieve this we need to equip teachers with the skills, resources, confidence and support they need to deliver this challenging curriculum.\u201d."

            "To take climate change action seriously, we need to create more benefits for industry and governments in adopting environmentally-friendly processes, urges Associate Professor Jun Huang from the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. His research focuses on developing new catalysts to ensure 'greener' and more sustainable fuels and industry processes. Associate Professor Huang\u2019s latest catalysts in development aim to express reactions between carbon dioxide and methane or hydrogen to produce valuable materials for chemical industries. Such materials include acetic acids, alcohol or hydrocarbons \u2013 such as alkene \u2013 which are often used in the production of fibres and fabrics, construction materials, food additives and antifreeze. \u201cThis research may give industries the potential to turn a profit from their carbon dioxide emissions, rather than releasing them into the environment\u201d, says Associate Professor Huang, who has recently received a Sydney Research Accelerator (SOAR) fellowship to further his research in this area.",
            "The yolk-albumen structure of Associate Professor Huang\u2019s new catalyst significantly enhances the stability and proficiency in CO 2 conversion. The fellowship also funds a second catalyst project of Associate Professor Huang, in which he aims to simulate the natural process of photosynthesis. Theoretically the catalyst would optimise a process that utilises solar energy, carbon dioxide and water to create valuable materials for chemical industries. \u201cThis research is exciting. These valuable chemicals are usually produced through industrial processes that have a detrimental impact on the environment\", says Associate Professor Huang. \"We\u2019re now uncovering the potential to create the same chemicals, using only sunlight, water and carbon dioxide, all whilst reducing carbon emissions.\u201d. The SOAR fellowships are a key initiative in the University of Sydney\u2019s 2016-20 Strategic Plan, helping outstanding up-and-coming research stars to fulfil their potential. Over the next two years this fellowship will allow Associate Professor Huang the financial support he needs to allocate the time and resources required to achieve his research goals in catalysts and \u2018greener\u2019 chemical processes."

            "From online shopping and streaming music to map directions and video games, there\u2019s a mobile app for just about everything. In fact, as of January 2018, mobile phone users had the choice of some 3.5 million apps via the Google Play Store and 2.1 million apps from Apple \u2013 the two leading app stores in the world. With mobile apps downloads globally expected to exceed 352.9 billion by 2021, the need for automated vetting of apps at entry is becoming increasingly important to prevent fake apps, possibly containing malware, from entering the marketplace. \u201cEntering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud,\u201d says Dr Suranga Seneviratne from the Centre for Distributed and High-Performance Computing (CDHPC). \u201cSome fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. Others encourage users to log in using Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. \u201cAutomated vetting of apps at entry is becoming a must and these methods have to include various checkpoints to detect different types of malware and dubious practices followed by some app developers.\u201d. To improve vetting practices, Dr Seneviratne and his colleagues are researching deep learning models capable of detecting counterfeit apps in the mobile device market. The project is being supported by the Google Faculty Research Awards program, which is designed to recognise and support world-class, permanent faculty staff pursuing cutting-edge research in areas of mutual interest. The award is highly competitive with only 15% of applicants receiving funding, and each proposal undergoing a rigorous Google-wide review process. Dr Seneviratne\u2019s project was one of only 152 projects accepted in the latest round of entries, from an original pool of 1,033 research proposals from more than 360 universities across 46 countries. \u201cWe are very happy to receive this award. It will enable us to conduct cutting-edge research in mobile security, an aspect of cybersecurity that is crucial for billions of smartphone users,\u201d says Dr Seneviratne. \u201cWe intend to focus on developing deep learning models that are capable of detecting counterfeit apps in mobile app markets. \u201cOur aim is to enable consumers to freely choose apps without the fear of malware or identity theft, and the associated costs to them and the community.\u201d."

            "Derek Fitzgerald didn\u2019t envisage becoming a wine maker when doing his Bachelor of Engineering (Chemical and Biomolecular). \u201cI\u2019d worked in various engineering roles both here in Australia and in the UK\u201d, says Derek. \u201cBut having developed a love of good wine from my wife Kirsten, I thought that winemaking could be a fun and interesting profession that still used the skills I\u2019d learnt in my engineering degree. \u201cI love all parts of winemaking \u2013 balancing the science with the more artistic aspect of blending to create something delicious that people want to drink with their dinner.\u201d. Working in small-to-medium wineries around Australia has been a great experience for Derek as it\u2019s enabled him to be involved in all parts of the business from capital projects and packaging to bottling, staff management and budgeting. After 20 years making wine, including an award-winning stint at Thorn Clarke, Derek and Kirsten felt the time was ripe to start their own winery \u2013 Paisley Wines \u2013 in the Barossa Valley in 2016. Beyond the funding and other challenges for any new business, Paisley Wines is trying to find its niche in the highly-competitive Australian market. In 2017, there was estimated to be 2468 wineries and 6251 grape-growers across 65 winegrowing regions in Australia, contributing over $40 billion annually to the Australian economy[1]. \u201cFor us the main challenge is getting noticed. There are numerous brands out there and new ones added every day, not only from Australia but from overseas, and the quality is generally very good to excellent\u201d, says Derek. \u201cFor us it needs to be a step at a time, selling the wine to use the cash injection to make larger quantities \u2013 to become self-sustaining while producing excellent wines.\u201d. \u201cThe many skills and experiences I\u2019ve gained from my chemical engineering degree and in working as an engineer have assisted my career path in winemaking. Obviously, it\u2019s the pure scientific principles from chemistry and engineering but also the problem-solving engineers do every day, and the management of teams or projects. Most importantly learning to being thorough and uncompromising has helped me every day.\u201d.

            "Dr Jacqueline Thomas established a WaSH research group during her four-year residency at Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania. Universal, affordable and sustainable access to WaSH is a key public health issue within global development and the focus of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal 6. According to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, inadequate sanitation alone affects approximately 40% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 2.5 billion people. It contributes to an estimated 700,000 child deaths every year due to diarrhea, while a lack of WaSH facilities can also impose an unusual burden on women and reduce work productivity. Dr Jacqueline Thomas, from the University of Sydney\u2019s School of Civil Engineering, aims to reduce these figures through her research into climate-resilient sanitation systems, particularly within developing countries across Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific as well as remote indigenous communities here in Australia. \"Improving access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene is critical to protecting human health as well as the environment,\" says Dr Thomas, who leads the Faculty of Engineering and IT\u2019s humanitarian engineering program. \u201cPoor sanitation comes from the unsafe containment and ineffective treatment of human waste, and causes disease as well as environmental degradation. It also represents a lost opportunity for nutrient and energy recovery. \u201cIn many developing countries, rapid urbanisation has led to large unplanned and un-serviced areas in which human faecal waste, greywater and solid waste are not safely treated but directly discharged into the environment.\u201d. Dr Thomas explains that this results in widespread disease as well as contamination of waterways. Further, it represents a lost opportunity to process this waste to produce, for example, biogas for cooking or bio-solids for fertiliser. \"The aim of my research is to design, implement and evaluate integrated, sustainable, climate-resilient water, sanitation and hygiene systems that can serve the world's most vulnerable rural and urban communities,\" says Thomas. Her achievements to date have included leading a project on the development of a rice husk-fired furnace to sterilise human waste and recapture nutrients and energy, creating safe biosolids for agricultural reuse. Through pyrolysis of dried faecal sludge, biochar brickets can be produced to replace the use of charcoal from virgin forests.",
            "Ms Fatuma Matwewe, part of the WaSH team at Ifakara Health Institute, collecting weather data in Kilombero District in Tanzania. The whole system can be operated by local entrepreneurs and will hopefully motivate significant up-take of ecologically sound sanitation. Prior to joining the University, Dr Thomas established a WaSH research group during her four-year residency at Ifakara Health Institute, a non-government organisation (NGO) based in Tanzania. Dr Thomas still works as an external collaborator with the Ifakara Health Institute, where she serves as the chief investigator on two WaSH projects funded by the UK\u2019s Department for International Development. The academic recently returned from a one-month fieldwork trip to the East African country, collaborating with local researchers and technicians to explore appropriate WaSH methods for water supply within local areas. \u201cI have been travelling to Tanzania to work with my collaborators for several years and to date our research has attracted more than $US1 million for WaSH funding,\" says Dr Thomas. \u201cThe recent fieldwork trip to Tanzania provided me the opportunity to examine the use of shallow open wells as a source of water supply by local communities within three different climatic regions. The regions were drought impacted (Kondoa), flood impacted (Kilombero) and extreme weather events impacted (Dar es Salaam).\u201d. The project which was implemented by the World Health Organisation (WHO), saw over 10,000 water quality samples taken over a period of 18 months and modelled the results to climate variability. \u201cThis study provides important recommendations on which climate resilient water sources the Tanzanian government should invest in,\" says Dr Thomas. \u201cIn Tanzania, the water supply is typically groundwater and can be easily contaminated by pit latrines. Interventions are a proven means to reduce diarrhoeal disease risk by around a third. \u201cOur research focuses on the effectiveness of household level water and sanitation interventions that could be brought to scale via market demand.\u201d.",

As each patient has a limited amount of bone available for grafting, the demand for synthetic bone substitutes is high. Through her biomedical engineering research, Professor Hala Zreiqat has developed a unique ceramic material that acts as a scaffold for the body to use to regenerate new bone and which gradually degrades as it is replaced by natural bone. The bone substitute resembles the architecture, strength and porosity of natural bone. It\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of a person and contains pores that allow blood and nutrients to flow through. With a long list of fellowships, awards and accolades, including being named the 2018 NSW Premier's Woman of the Year, Professor Zreiqat is an inspiring female engineer who is passionate about attracting women to STEMM, as well as promoting inclusion and diversity in academia through the IDEAL society network. Professor Zreiqat believes we need a greater number of women in key leadership and policy roles. \u201cI would like to see more women on boards contributing to STEMM decisions. I would also like to see greater public recognition of women for their outstanding achievements. \u201cI am a strong believer in mentoring at all levels.

            "Professional experience has always been a mandatory component of professional engineering programs at the University of Sydney, cementing theoretical learning with practical application through professional practice. Traditionally, students have completed a 12-week industry internship undertaken around the end of their third year of study. Whilst this approach has been effective, students and their industry partners would benefit from better student preparation for their internship and a deeper understanding of the professional and social contexts in which engineering knowledge is applied in practice. The result is our latest education initiative, the Professional Engagement Program (PEP). It will be a mandatory requirement for all our professional engineering degree programs from 2018. The new PEP requires students to begin the process of professional engagement from their first day of study, and accumulate a minimum of 600 hours of professional engagement activities over the four-year duration of their degree. These activities are a combination of technical engineering-focused skills development, transferable skills development and professional engineering practice in industry. Student progress is monitored and assessed through a series of workshops that must be completed every semester. This continuous professional engagement, underpinned by regular review and reflection, will result in graduates who are better equipped to face the complex challenges of global professional engineering practice. Professor David Lowe, Associate Dean (Education) in the Faculty of Engineering and IT has said that PEP is further evidence as to why the University holds the number one market leadership position in Australia and fourth in the world for graduate employability. \u201cOur Professional Engagement Program goes beyond the model used elsewhere, where students gain exposure to practice as an isolated experience late in their degree\u201d, explains Professor Lowe. \u201cInstead, our innovative sector-leading program ensures that students engage strongly with the nature of professional practice continuously throughout their degree. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that our graduates develop not only outstanding technical skills, but also a deep ability to apply these skills in addressing real-world challenges and opportunities with insight, innovation and leadership.\u201d."

            "Awarded the Grahame Mechanical Engineering Prize for excellence in engineering (2000) and the Dean's Engineering Scholarship for Academic Excellence, 1999\u20132004, Rachel set her mind to achieving great things as she completed her double degree in biomedical engineering and science at the University of Sydney. After completing her undergraduate study, she was offered a place in the Doctor of Medicine program at Sydney. However, her successful modelling career took her overseas to London and she went on to graduate in Medicine at the University of Oxford in the UK. She currently practices as a doctor in London and is now developing health technology platforms while completing a master's degree in the neuroscience and psychology of mental health. The British Medical Association's Young Author of the Year 2016, Rachel has written two medical text books (Practical Medical Procedures at a Glance and Medical School at a Glance) as well as peer-reviewed journal articles. If it were possible to fit anything more into her busy professional life, Rachel also manages to speak at schools, universities and institutions to encourage more young women into Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) or Medicine. We asked Rachel what drives her passion and what vision she sees coming into fruition in the next five years for biomedical engineering in the personalised medical field. What do you enjoy most about your current role?. I enjoy the challenge of solving healthcare-related problems. I'm fortunate to be able to do this in different ways: clinically with patients as a doctor, by writing education books for healthcare professionals, and through devising technological solutions for larger issues. Why did you decide to do a Bachelor of Engineering (Biomedical)?. I was interested in learning how to improve health and healthcare. I felt biomedical engineering could teach a different approach to problem-solving, building (a bridge) between medical technologies and clinical medicine. What do you remember enjoying most during your time at the University?. Sydney University provides amazing opportunities to educate yourself in ways you hadn't imagined needing. I was able to study abroad at the University of California, Berkeley, on an exchange scholarship, which was great fun and very interesting. And I was in SUDS (the Sydney University Dramatic Society) which I really enjoyed too. Have there been any pivotal moments or choices made during your career that have impacted your success or progress? What did you learn from that experience?. The decision to study medicine after I had completed my biomedical engineering and science double degree has obviously had a big impact on my career. I studied this at Oxford University and was able to learn more, not only about clinical medicine and patient experiences, but also about different healthcare systems. What has been your greatest achievement to date \u2013 something that you are particularly proud of? What helped you to reach that goal?. I was honoured to be voted the British Medical Association's 'Best Young Author of the Year, 2016', based on the publication of my medical education books. I was pleased to realise that these books are helping medical students, doctors and healthcare professionals with their training, as well as helping to deliver better quality care to patients. Is there a stand-out innovation or change in your field of expertise that has shifted the way things are done?. I think that the increasing use of artificial intelligence in medicine will be for the better. While there is some reluctance to accept it, I think it will free up doctors to spend more time with patients rather than looking at computer screens. And that is a good thing. What advice would you give to a young person considering studying biomedical engineering?. Do it! It provides an excellent framework for how to think about different problems and how to devise solutions for them. This is obviously relevant in healthcare, but also in wider areas of service provision and other fields. I am also actively involved in encouraging girls to get and stay involved in science and engineering \u2013 any of the STEM subjects really, as women are still under-represented in these areas. What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in your field of expertise in the next five years?. There is an explosion of fascinating research at the moment. I am currently looking at the neuroscience and psychology of mental health, with a view to a technological solution in this space. Personalised medicine, where therapeutics are targeted depending on your genetic make-up, will start becoming more widespread \u2013 and Biomedical Engineers will be helping this to become a reality."

            "Alumna Thanh Van Dang graduated with a computer science degree from the University of Sydney. Thanh Van Dang is CEO of Savvycom, one of 2017\u2019s Top 30 Global Mobile App Developers. She built the company from the ground up and now leads a team of 100 engineers \u2013 a significant achievement for anyone but particularly for a woman from the rural provinces of Vietnam. It\u2019s the kind of success she hopes will inspire others to achieve with hard work and perseverance. \u201cFour years living and studying in Australia opened my mind,\" says Van, who graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology in 2004. \"Back then my goal was to leave poverty, but now I am driven to succeed and to not only support other women, but to create an oasis where women can support each other.\". As a child of seven Van happily sold peanuts and produce in the village market to help her mother afford everyday needs. Her father, a soldier, came home twice a year. As she grew older Van began to question why some people could afford new clothes while her one new t-shirt each year was a luxury; why some families had new motorbikes and theirs continually broke down; why others travelled the world when her world spanned 80km. It was only when her father purchased an old computer to hire out to their fellow villagers that Van\u2019s world expanded. She learned English at night school and taught herself to write simple code in Pascal to run a clock. Her excellent high school grades enabled her to study computer science at Hanoi University without sitting the entrance exam. Despite the $30 scholarship application fee of the time being a month\u2019s living expense for Van, the opportunity to study in Australia under an Australian Awards scholarship was worth the risk. Upon graduating with her computer science degree, Van returned to Vietnam where she worked in many different roles from researcher to business consultant and coder and representative. These experiences provided a great foundation for starting her own software company in 2009. Van continues to be one of a few successful women in technology, not only in Vietnam but worldwide. \u201cIn the USA, only 12% of degrees in computer science are completed by women and many women (some 56%) leave their roles in mid-career, and the statistics in Vietnam are similar,\" says Van. At the University of Sydney, some 26.4% of people completing computer science degrees in 2017 were women, but there is still room for improvement. Empowering women to pursue careers in computer science and stick with it is something Van is passionate about. She told her own inspiring story about what it takes to be a female entrepreneur at TEDx BaDinh 2017 as well as the 2017 APEC Conference Women Business & Smart Technology Seminar and HNEW Empowering Vietnam Women Entrepreneurs. \u201cI\u2019m a deep believer that we need more women in leadership roles,\u201d says Van. \u201cI will strive to contribute to a community dedicated to helping women to build resilience and find strength in the face of adversity, with shared stories, solidarity and support groups.\".",

            "In partnership with Engineers Without Borders Australia (EWB), 29 students from various engineering disciplines ventured to Gujarat, India as a part of the Humanitarian Engineering major. This global engineering fieldwork trip is a core component of the major requiring students to undertake work in either a developing country or indigenous community. \u201cUnderstanding the complexity of work in developing countries is one of the most important lessons a young engineer can take away from our program\u201d, says Dr Jacqueline Thomas, who oversees the major within the School of Civil Engineering. \u201cIndia was selected for this reason: it\u2019s a complex society made up of a large diversity of religions and castes that interplay with a democratic government. This means that engineers need to consider many different stakeholders with different perspectives when undertaking any project.\u201d The fieldwork trip allowed students to visit different villages within the western Indian state and collaborate with a local women\u2019s non-government organisation (NGO). One group travelled to Bakutra, where handcraft is a primary source of income, to learn about the latest techniques in construction to protect residences from the large earthquakes common to the region. Another ventured to Navapura, home to large caster plant crops used for caster oil, and delved into the complexity of high levels of irrigation and the effects this has had on ground water levels across the region. During this period, students also worked on numerous design projects identified by the communities. One such group worked on reducing smoke inhalation within their host family\u2019s house by constructing and installing a small chimney to filter out smoke produced from the kitchen area when used for cooking. Other projects focused on safe water supply, irrigation and small-scale industries. Students met with both community members and the local women\u2019s NGO towards the end of their trip to present their findings and solutions on better design and planning practices. They are now in the process of providing a comprehensive report of their engineering ideas that the Gujarat communities can action. \u201cThe response from the NGO to our students\u2019 presentations were extremely positive. They are excited to develop and act on these designs and plans in the near future\u201d, says Thomas. \u201cStudents were hosted by a family and living a rural Indian life, giving them the unique experience of being able to immerse themselves in local customs, language and traditions. A few were even lucky enough to be invited to a local wedding!\u201d."

            "An image derived from Lewis Martin's simulations that depicts the immobilised peptides (purple) attached to the surface of an implanted biodevice (top red) and interacting with the receptor of a cell membrane protein (brown) incorporated in the cell membrane (green bottom). Modern medicine increasingly relies on implantable biomedical devices but their effectiveness is often limited because of unsuccessful integration with host tissue or the development of untreatable infections, necessitating replacement of the device through revision surgery. The team at the Applied Plasma Physics and Surface Engineering Laboratory has developed practical techniques to guide and attach peptides to surfaces; computer simulations and experiments demonstrated control of both peptide orientation and surface concentration, which can be achieved by applying an electric field like that delivered by a small household-sized battery. The findings were published this week in Nature Communications. Corresponding author Professor of Applied Physics and Surface Engineering Marcela Bilek said biomaterial coatings can mask the implanted devices and mimic surrounding tissue. \u201cThe holy grail is a surface that interacts seamlessly and naturally with host tissue through biomolecular signalling,\u201d said Professor Bilek, who is a member of the University of Sydney Nano Institute and the Charles Perkins Centre. Robust attachment of biological molecules to the bio-device surface is required to achieve this, as enabled by unique surface modification processes developed by Professor Bilek. \u201cAlthough proteins have successfully been used in a number of applications, they don\u2019t always survive harsh sterilisation treatments \u2013 and introduce the risk of pathogen transfer due to their production in micro-organisms,\u201d Professor Bilek said. Professor Bilek \u2013 together with Dr Behnam Akhavan from the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering and the School of Physics and lead author, PhD candidate Lewis Martin from the School of Physics \u2013 are exploring the use of short protein segments called peptides that, when strategically designed, can recapitulate the function of the protein. Mr Martin said the team was able to tune the orientation of extremely small biomolecules (less than 10 nanometres in size) on the surface. \u201cWe used specialised equipment to perform the experiments, but the electric fields could be applied by anyone using a home electronics kit,\u201d he said.",
            "Control of peptide orientation by electric field. Charge separation on one end of the peptide creates a dipole moment (indicated by ellipses) that aligns with the electric field and rotates the entire molecule. When the peptide makes contact with the radical-functionalized surface it becomes irreversibly anchored in this orientation. Dr Akhavan said that assuming industry support and funding for clinical trials, improved implants could be available to patients within five years. \u201cThe application of our approach ranges from bone-implants to cardiovascular stents and artificial blood vessels,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the bone implantable devices, for example, such modern bio-compatible surfaces will directly benefit patients suffering from bone fracture, osteoporosis and bone cancer.\u201d. Because of their small size, the peptides can be produced synthetically and they are resilient during sterilisation. The main difficulty in using peptides is ensuring they are attached at appropriate densities and in orientations that effectively expose their active sites. Using applied electric fields and buffer chemistry, the researchers discovered several new levers that control peptide attachment. Charge separation on peptides creates permanent dipole moments that can be aligned with an electric field to provide optimal orientation of the molecules and the amount of peptide immobilised can also be tuned by the electrostatic interactions when the peptides have an overall charge. The paper said this knowledge is being used to design strategies to create a new generation of synthetic biomolecules. \u201cOur findings shed light on mechanisms of biomolecule immobilisation that are extremely important for the design of synthetic peptides and biofunctionalisation of advanced implantable materials,\u201d the paper states."

            "Mahshid Farzanehsa, Phd candidate. Wastewater treatment is a major challenge for Australia\u2019s food industry. Many manufacturers rely on ultrafiltration systems to filter their wastewater before allowing it to enter the ecosystem. Ultrafiltration systems utilise specially-designed membranes that allow certain molecules to pass through, separating the water from contaminants. The problem with these systems is the effects of \u2018membrane fouling\u2019, where particles begin to build up on the membrane wall and reduce the system\u2019s ability to effectively filter the fluids passing through. At the ARC Training Centre for the Australian Food Processing Industry, Mahshid Farzanehsa, a PhD candidate in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, is working on solutions to the problem of membrane fouling. Traditionally, fouling is addressed with a washing procedure to recover the flow of the fluid passing through the membrane to its initial state. Mahshid is developing \u2018fouling-resistant\u2019 membranes to maintain a constant flow.",
            "Ultrafiltration equipment used for testing in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular laboratory. \u201cMembrane fouling seems to be the \u2018Achilles heel\u2019 of membrane filtration technology. Apart from fouling, membrane technology provides a great wastewater treatment solution. They have effective separation rates, whilst taking up very little space. They can also be used to process heat sensitive products such as juice and dairy products\u201d, says Mahshid. If Mahshid can enhance membrane process efficiency, she could save Australia\u2019s food processing industry a significant amount of time, energy and financial resources. It could also mean better access to clean drinking water in rural communities. Mahshid recently received an Endeavour scholarship which will enable her to take her research in membrane fouling to the University of British Columbia. There she will expand on her knowledge and experience gained at the University of Sydney to learn novel techniques in fouling elimination being developed in Vancouver. \u201cAt the University of British Colombia, I will focus on membrane surface characteristics such as hydrophobicity and surface charge to reduce fouling rate during the filtration of drinkable water. This research will hopefully facilitate and enhance the water filtration process\u201d, says Mahshid. The inspired PhD candidate is set to head to Vancouver, Canada in September this year to continue her search for an answer to Australia\u2019s water shortage."

            "Millions of people worldwide suffer bone loss due to injury, infection, disease or abnormal skeletal development. The new implant developed by Professor Hala Zreiqat and her multidisciplinary team based in the Faculty of Engineering has the same strength as real bone and dissolves over time without discomfort or need for further surgery. Professor Zreiquat\u2019s team have already demonstrated that the new material can completely heal broken arm bones in rabbits. Now, in work about to be published, they have shown it can also repair large leg fractures in sheep. The eight sheep in the study were able to walk on the implants immediately after surgery, with plaster casts helping to stabilise their legs for the first four weeks. Results showed complete healing in 25 per cent of the fractures after three months and 88 per cent after one year.",
            "\"The bone substitute we have developed resembles natural bone in terms of architecture, strength and porosity,\u201d says Professor Zreiqat. \u201cBy allowing blood and nutrients to penetrate the supporting material, normal bone growth is encouraged which will eventually replace the gradually dissolving scaffold.\u201d. The sheep involved in the trials tolerated the implants well, with no evidence of toxic side effects as the implants dissolved. The \u201cink\u201d the team used in the 3D-printing process was a mixture of calcium silicate, a mineral called gahnite, and small amounts of strontium and zinc that are found as trace elements in bone. Current structural supports such as metal plates and screws can cause the patient discomfort, and bone grafts are often rejected by the patient\u2019s immune system.",
            "Each patient only has a limited amount of bone available for grafting making the demand for synthetic bone substitutes high. The unique ceramic material being developed by Professor Zreiqat\u2019s team will also solve this growing problem worldwide. Human trials are the next step, starting with the repair of spinal defects and broken jaws before testing the scaffolds on larger fractures in load-bearing bones in the legs and hips. \"This material has the potential to positively affect the quality of life of millions of people globally, so we are hoping to see it in use clinically within the next 10 years.\u201d."

Professor Ariyaratne has completed 50 years\u2019 service as a professional engineer, 47 years of which have been with the Department of Main Roads/Roads and Traffic Authority/Roads and Maritime Services (RMS). Until his retirement in February 2019, for almost 20 years he worked as the Director of Bridges and Structures. During this period, he was responsible for managing the technical risk of Australia\u2019s oldest and most complex bridge assets, comprising of over 6,000 bridges with a replacement value of about $20 billion. Among his many achievements, Professor Ariyaratne has pioneered the development of a dedicated bridge load testing facility: the only such facility in Australia that resulted in more than $150 million in revenue being saved during the New South Wales bridge upgrade program of the mid 1990s. This method is still used to approve travel of heavy vehicles on Transport for NSW road network bridges, which bringing in millions of dollars of revenue to New South Wales. As a result of his innovations and the effective delivery of infrastructure, in December 2018 Professor Ariyaratne was awarded the prestigious New South Wales Premier\u2019s Award for Infrastructure Delivery. He also chaired the national committee that reviewed the Bridge Design Code for Australia and New Zealand which was published in March 2017."

            "Reducing the amount of server latency makes loading web resources faster. ( Photo source: USENIX). Working alongside the Professor Willy Zwaenepoel, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, and computer science researcher Dr Florin Dinu, the research paper focused on developing a method to overcome latency spikes. The large-scale storing and processing of online data is a challenge faced by most organisations, and its importance is only set to rise as our professional and personal lives are increasingly experi-enced online. Logging into an online account, downloading a file from a cloud server, watching a video on YouTube or liking someone\u2019s social posts make up just a fraction of the millions of requests large online databases, such as Google, iCloud and Facebook, answer each second. Traffic increases mean that online servers must play catch up, recalibrating and optimising their response times. The researchers\u2019 work aims to decrease such response times, that are commonly slowed due to poor sharing of computing resources. \u201cJust like driving in peak hour, a spike in traffic can cause a bottleneck of requests. We\u2019ve all experienced a slow website \u2014 often the cause is an inundation of requests \u2014 we call this an increase in latency,\u201d explained Oana.",
            "Oana Balmau is currently studying Computer Science. Photo source: Luisa Low/University of Sydney). Professor Zwaenepoel emphasised that there is a growing need for technology that effectively deals with surges in traffic \u2014 a need that will only become more pronounced as the online world becomes the centre point for most commercial activity. \u201cAs more people come online, large online servers are dealing with an increasing level of traffic and requests each day. Our method focuses on generating shorter response times for customer requests to ensure performance predictability and improve user experience,\u201d said Professor Willy Zwaenepoel. \u201cThis reliability requires complex infrastructure, however the issue is large online services need to create a predictable experience while dealing with large swathes less-predictable requests.\". According to Oana, online systems such as Facebook, Google and iCloud are experiencing a period of rapid expansion. By providing lower latency and better predictability, she believes her research will improve the reliability of data transmission. \u201cImprovements might be in seconds or milliseconds, however, this all adds up. Improved latency contributes to greater productivity and a better user experience,\u201d said Oana. \u201cWe have designed a scheduler that ensures the computing resources are split productively between the customer requests and routine maintenance work. Our solution ensures that customer requests are never blocked by maintenance work,\u201d she said. Usenix ATC is one of the industry\u2019s largest conferences, attended by researchers from across the globe. \u201cThis was our very first appearance at Usenix so it\u2019s remarkable that we have won the best paper award!\u201d Professor Zwaenepoel concluded. Disclosure. The research has been conducted in collaboration with Silicon Valley software company, Nutanix. The code used for the paper is open-source."

            "For University of Sydney engineering student Bethany O\u2019Neill, the end goal was always to create positive change in people\u2019s lives. Equipped with a passion for mathematics and science, she found the means to achieve her mission in the field of biomedical engineering, which combines knowledge of various types of engineering with the life sciences to create devices that enhance human lives and improve medical services. Bethany found an avenue to perform life-changing work through the Engineering Sydney Industry Placement Scholarship (ESIPS), a program designed to provide students with on-the-job experience as part of an industry team under the guidance of an industry mentor and academic supervisor. Through ESIPS, Bethany completed a six-month placement with Cochlear \u2014 a global leader in implantable hearing solutions. The company, headquartered in Sydney, strives to help people struggling with hearing loss live full and active lives. It has to date provided over 550,000 implantable devices to recipients in over 100 countries. At Cochlear, Bethany was able to apply what she learnt in the classroom to the workplace, where she performed research, design, lab work, and data analysis to improve the company\u2019s products and operations. \u201cAlready having experience in both electrical and science labs and knowledge of subjects like engineering mechanics, materials and statistics, I was able to confidently operate in labs at Cochlear with minimal supervision,\u201d says Bethany, who is pursuing both a Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Biomedical) and Bachelor of Medical Science. Her specific project involved designing, building and testing antenna coils for prototype cochlear implants \u2013 the component that receives power and data from the external device through a transcutaneous inductive link. She cites the most difficult part of her project to be the satisfaction of conflicting design requirements. \u201cThe electrical team wanted a coil that maximised power transfer efficiency to extend battery life, while the mechanical team wanted a coil that was strong and could withstand regulatory mechanical safety requirements,\u201d explains Bethany. \u201cMeanwhile, the cost of production had to also be low in order to make the product affordable and accessible to as many people as possible.\u201d. Bethany succeeded in changing the coil material, insulation and winding configuration to create a prototype that met all three requirements. In the process, she also became familiar with tooling changes, work instruction updates and alterations to material purchasing that are involved with implementing a coil design change. She highlights working in a team environment as one of the most valuable parts of her experience, as it allowed her to brainstorm ideas and learn from a variety of people with experience in biomedical, mechanical and electrical engineering. Despite having minimal professional experience, she still felt that she was able to contribute a new perspective to team discussions and make an impact within the company. \u201cOverall, the ESIPS placement was a challenging, but a highly rewarding opportunity that allowed me to work both independently and in a team, to actively seek information and be creative in solving open-ended problems.\u201d. \u201cWithout a doubt, the best part of my placement at Cochlear was knowing that my work contributed to providing the gift of hearing to people who receive these life-changing devices.\u201d. The Engineering Sydney Industry Placement Scholarship program is valued at $18,000 and designed to place some of our highest achieving students studying either an undergraduate engineering degree or a Master of Professional Engineering within leading industry companies during their final year of studies. Over the course of a six-month full-time industry placement, each student involved in the program undertakes a high-level investigative project based on the needs of their partner organisation, with the outcomes ultimately being presented to the company. This industry placement also meets fourth-year course requirements, providing participating students with valuable work experience and six-months credit towards the completion of their engineering degree with no additional time added."

            "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the immense potential to revolutionise both business and society and fundamentally transform the way people do work. Encompassing big data, sophisticated robots, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms, it is projected that AI can, and will, transform industries like healthcare, mining, transport, and finance by enabling quicker decision making, more accurate analysis, improved customer experience, and increased productivity. Amongst the global leaders of this AI revolution is China. Almost 50% of total equity funding of AI start-ups globally came from China in 2017, which is higher than the rest of the world. With China\u2019s new AI strategy, China\u2019s core AI industry gross output and AI-related industry gross output is projected to exceed $22.5 billion and $150.8 billion, respectively. So, when mechatronic engineering student Sholto Douglas was offered the opportunity to study AI at Tsinghua University, one of China\u2019s leading engineering institutions, it was one he seized with both hands. Afterall, the university is located at the centre of Zhonguancun, China\u2019s equivalent of Silicon Valley where nearly 9,000 hi-tech firms are based, including Baidu and Sina Corp, which are China\u2019s equivalents of Google and Twitter. \u201cWhen I was offered the chance to study at Tsinghua University, there was no hesitation,\u201d explains Sholto, who is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering Honours with Space Engineering Major and a Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Sydney. \u201cIt\u2019s located in Zhonguancun where as many as 80 new tech start-ups are being born each day.\u201d. During his nearly five-month tenure at Tsinghua University, Sholto studied machine learning, computational biology, mathematics, and developmental economics. When not in the lecture theatre or laboratory, he was outside pursing his passion for fencing by training and honing his skills alongside China\u2019s national team.",
            "Sholto was later able to apply his machine learning skills in industry while also growing his professional network by undertaking several work placements across the region. His first placement was in Hong Kong with Zeroth, Asia\u2019s first accelerator program backing AI start-ups, where he helped advise many of the companies they were funding. Sholto then travelled to Beijing, the capital of China, where he worked with JD.com, China\u2019s version of Amazon, to create their AI accelerator. Looking towards the future, Sholto hopes to use what he has learnt in China to further expand Australia\u2019s own AI industry, which has the potential to boost Australia\u2019s national income by as much as $2.2 trillion by 2030. \u201cIf we can learn and work in tandem with these countries at the forefront of AI research, we\u2019ll have better odds of shaping AI to be beneficial to the world,\u201d reflects Sholto. \u201cMy experiences in China only reinforced to me the fundamental similarities between all of us and exposed just how big people dream there. \u201cChina\u2019s approaching developing technology with such incredible pace, eagerness and commitment, which we can all definitely draw inspiration from. \u201cI look forward to contributing to that here in Australia.\u201d. Sholto was able to study abroad due to support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's New Colombo Plan Scholarship, which provides opportunities for Australian undergraduate students to undertake semester-based study and internships or mentorships in 40 participating Indo-Pacific locations. Opportunities like Sholto\u2019s to undertake valuable industry experience abroad is one way our undergraduate engineering students can contribute towards their mandatory Professional Engagement Program requirements. Our award-winning PEP program encompasses all our undergraduate engineering degrees. It aims to develop our undergraduate engineering students\u2019 workplace competencies and transferable employability skills that companies look for in engineering graduates."

            "University of Sydney alumnus Joshua Gibbons has always had a penchant to tinker with things to discover how they work. As a child he could be found building towering structures from plastic blocks and designing his own functional mechanisms using metal construction models. It was therefore only natural for him to pursue a mechatronic engineering degree when the time came so he could transform his childhood passion into a full-fledged career. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed learning and creatively solving problems and playing with Lego Technic and Meccano kits are some of my fondest memories,\u201d explains Joshua. \u201cSo when it came time to pursue my interests at university, studying mechatronic engineering stood out as the obvious choice purely for its combination of mechanical, electronic and software engineering disciplines.\u201d. Later while studying his Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Mechatronic), Joshua decided he wanted to compliment what he was learning in the classroom with important practical hands-on professional experience to further develop his technical and critical thinking skills. He pursued, and ultimately secured, an industry placement with Thomas Global Systems, a pioneer in the production of innovative electronic systems solutions for aerospace and defense. \u201cThis was a great opportunity to put into practice many of the engineering concepts taught in the classroom and provide context for much of the content,\" notes Joshua. \u201cFor instance, learning about the groundwork of microcontroller programming with approaches such as interrupts and circular buffers allowed me to start contributing to Thomas Global Systems immediately. \u201cI was able to apply what I learnt in my mechatronic core units to a work project creating a hardware 'firewall' for a CAN bus.\". Joshua now works as a Development Engineer at the aviation multinational, using his mechanical, electrical and software design skills to produce early proof of concept prototypes and assist with the initial designs of new products. This may someday complement existing Thomas Global Systems-created products including primary flight displays present in the flight decks of commercial airlines and biocular sighting equipment used in military vehicles. As part of an assignment for his new company, Joshua travelled to the United States for three months to study Biocular Image Control Units (BICU), which are used in military vehicle sighting operations. Joshua intends to use this training located in Irvine, California to assist Thomas Global Systems in developing a next-generation BICU which uses high resolution LCD panels and 4K cameras. \u201cThe strong research skills I obtained during my degree are an invaluable asset in the information age,\u201d says Joshua. \u201cIt\u2019s something that can be transferred into any career, which I\u2019m doing now with Thomas Global Systems.\u201d. Opportunities like Joshua's to undertake valuable industry experience is one way our undergraduate engineering students can contribute towards their mandatory Professional Engagement Program requirements.

            "The Faculty of Engineering has implemented the Professional Engagement Program, a new model of how we expose students to industry and professional work. In lieu of the traditional 12-week summer placements between third and fourth years, the Professional Engagement Program (PEP) requires students to complete 600 hours of in-curricular and extra-curricular activities, designed to develop student\u2019s workplace competencies and transferrable employability skills that companies look for in engineering graduates. These activities have included everything from industry projects, guest lectures and sites visits to non-engineering extra-circular activities including volunteering, playing in a band or even a part-time job. Self-reflection and peer review are central to the program\u2019s success, as it encourages students to draw links between their experiences and learning to purposefully identify where they have opportunity to develop interpersonal and professional skills. We spoke with current engineering students to find out how they are finding the first year of the program and if it has helped to shape their experience at university.",
            "Kiri \u2013 Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Chemical and Biomolecular) / Bachelor of Science. My PEP hours have included paid employment like sports coaching, copywriting for a florist and an online short course on communications through Lynda. It\u2019s through these types of PEP activities that I\u2019ve gained a greater knowledge of what it means to be an engineer and develop the skills that will be required in the workplace, such as leadership and effective communication. My advice for others doing PEP is to make good use of the suggested PEP activities page. Nelson \u2013 Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Aeronautical). At first, I didn\u2019t really value the idea of \u2018reflective learning\u2019 that is quite central to the program. This changed when I realised that this introspection was lacking in my other engineering units. We evaluate ideas, learn to use modern tools and techniques for problem solving, but you\u2019re never asked to focus on how you fit into the world of engineering. PEP pushes you to consider \u2018what skills can I work on to make myself a better engineer, community member or colleague? What activities are best to help me develop those skills?\u2019. PEP motivated me to pursue my interest in producing protheses by setting up a Sydney Chapter of the charity e-NABLE where I can use the University Fab Lab facilities to 3D print parts for prostheses hands. My advice for others doing PEP is to embrace the fact that your education requires extra-curricular activity to really thrive as an engineer. Sonya - Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Chemical and Biomolecular) / Bachelor of Science. This program has, in a number of ways, engaged me to seek out opportunities for growth \u2013 both professionally and personally. It has shown me that the process of reflection is a powerful tool as it enables development of myself, my actions and my interactions in whatever role I find myself in. I\u2019ve participated in activities and events that exposed me to new people and new ideas, such as a creative thinking workshop at the Commonwealth Bank and a site tour of a brewery. My advice for others doing PEP is to have a positive attitude towards the program will make it an enjoyable learning experience rather than a chore. The organisers go to great lengths to supply students with a huge variety of ideas for activities that are PEP-appropriate, organised both within the university and by external parties like Engineers Australia.",

            "University of Sydney materials engineers Professor Julie Cairney and Dr Yi-Sheng Chen will collaborate with CITIC Metal on research designed to examine how hydrogen embrittlement occurs in steel. Hydrogen embrittlement refers to the process by which certain metals become susceptible to early fracture due to the absorption of hydrogen. \u201cHydrogen wreaks havoc in many alloys, leading to embrittlement that can cause catastrophic failure for any industry in which structures are exposed to this ubiquitous element,\u201d explains Professor Cairney from the School of Aeronautical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering. \u201cUnfortunately, comprehending the behaviour of hydrogen in these alloys is restrictive due to the actual difficulty of observing tiny, light and mobile hydrogen atoms.\u201d. Professor Cairney and Dr Chen\u2019s research project intends to explain where hydrogen goes in exposed high-strength steel by 3D-mapping the position of hydrogen atoms at the atomic scale within the alloy. This imaging will be enabled by using atom probe tomography, a flagship microscopy technique housed within the Australian Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis. \u201cOur research will elucidate how a proposed solution, hydrogen trapping, reduces hydrogen embrittlement, contributing to design criteria for hydrogen-resistant steels,\u201d says Professor Cairney. \u201cWe intend to replace the hydrogen with deuterium \u2013 the rarer isotope of hydrogen, which has an additional neutron and behaves similarly to hydrogen at atomic scale. \u201cIt will also serve to remove any ambiguity caused by the ubiquity of background hydrogen signals within most analytical instruments. \u201cThis sample will be kept extremely cold, so that the normally-mobile hydrogen and deuterium atoms stay in place for the atom probe experiment.\u201d.",
            "For both researchers, understanding the distribution of hydrogen atoms in metals is an important first step towards ultimately designing hydrogen-resistant steels. High strength hydrogen-resistant steels will allow lighter components for the automotive industry, which traditionally relies on heavier, thicker traditional steel components to produce the body and chassis of vehicles. \u201cHydrogen embrittlement is one of the major limitations to the usage of steel material for fuel-effective light-weight cars,\u201d explains Dr Chen, a University of Sydney Fellow also within the School of Aeronautical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering. \u201cA vehicle made out of lighter components requires less energy during service, while offering the same levels of performance. \u201cHowever, the current susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement means that steels possessing higher strength and a higher embrittlement risk are generally not considered in the design stage as it compromises safety.\u201d. CITIC Metal, a supplier of niobium, will partner with both researchers on the project to understand the effectiveness of adding niobium to mitigate hydrogen embrittlement in high-strength steels."

            "In partnership with mobility partner Authentica, 14 students from various engineering disciplines travelled to Maharashtra in India as a part of the Humanitarian Engineering major. This global engineering fieldwork trip is a core component of the major requiring students to undertake work in either a developing country or indigenous community. \u201cThis is the third year we have taken students to India supported by funding from the New Colombo Plan,\" says Dr Jacqueline Thomas, who oversees the major within the School of Civil Engineering. \u201cDoing so has provided our humanitarian engineering students hands on experience of the challenges faced in India and the difficulties faced by an engineer working in a developing country.\u201d. This fieldwork trip allowed students to collaborate with organisations on five social responsibility projects within the city of Pune, the second largest city in the west-central Indian state. Three groups worked on projects associated with Gathagram, a proposed township to be built in Pune by construction and design property development company Orange Country Group. One group investigated strategies to enhance the sustainability of the proposed township, while another researched how best to safeguard the precinct against natural hazards. The third were tasked with assessing the practicality of making Garthagram\u2019s hospital a carbon neutral standalone building by evaluating the building\u2019s power management and generation, waste management and water management infrastructures. A separate group partnered with SWaCH, a wholly-owned workers\u2019 cooperative that advocate for better working conditions of waste pickers, to review design requirements for sorting sheds across the city. They analysed problems faced by waste pickers in sorting sheds, including facility layout, water and sanitation, and human factors. Another collected data on behalf of Saraplast as part of an ongoing \u2018Uber for Waste Management\u2019 research project intended to identify potential customers for septic tank services using a mobile app.",
            "All five student groups are now in the process of providing comprehensive reports of their engineering ideas for their respective industry partners. The student generated ideas can provide valuable input for partners organisations as they progress to project implementation. \u201cThis fieldwork trip allowed us to apply our engineering knowledge to projects that will make a tangible difference to the community of Pune,\u201d says Kiran Singh, a fifth-year Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Electrical) / Bachelor of Science (Advanced Mathematics) student who participated in the fieldwork trip. \u201cBeing able to work firsthand with industry organisations has not only added to my professional experience but also provided me with scope to view issues from the perspective of others.\u201d. In addition to gaining valuable practical experience, the students also had opportunities to learn more about the local customs, languages and traditions of Pune. Highlights included exploring the many markets and temples across the city, participation in a Bollywood dance class and sampling a traditional Indian thali \u2013 a round platter comprising of various food. \u201cThe program fosters independence and a mechanism for students to become immersed in Indian culture,\u201d says Dr Thomas. \u201cIt\u2019s always rewarding to see their confidence grow as they adapt to the location, master using auto rickshaws as transport and discovering the best places to eat!\u201d. The Humanitarian Engineering major is available to engineering students studying within the Faculty of Engineering. Students have previously conducted global fieldwork trips in Samoa and will later this year have opportunities to travel to Myanmar as well as India."

            "Professor Dacheng Tao, Director of the UBTECH Sydney Artificial Intelligence Centre has focused his research on the intersection between artificial intelligence and data mining, with his most recently awarded work having achieved an effective, robust and succinct representation of original high-dimensional, noisy and unstructured raw data. Representation learning is essential because real-world data such as images, video, and text are mathematically and computationally inconvenient for specific machine learning tasks, such as classification and clustering. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to be awarded an IEEE ICDM research contributions award,\" said Professor Tao, from the School of Computer Science. \"Not only has it recognised my effort and contributions to date, it has also strengthened my commitment to research in data mining and artificial intelligence, in particular representation learning. \u201cThe field of artificial intelligence is blossoming; it\u2019s driving both economic growth and social progress in what is now the world\u2019s fourth industrial revolution.\u201d. Having recently completed an ARC Future Fellowship, Professor Tao\u2019s recent research has concentrated on developing multi-view learning, a process which allows machines or robots to consider data from multiple data sets, forming a more comprehensive view and allowing them to behave accordingly. \u201cMulti-view learning is essential for intelligent systems, in that those systems need to complete tasks based on the input data from different sensors,\" explains Professor Tao. \u201cWe have developed algorithms that can learn an effective integrated feature from different sources for the subsequent processing, such as classification, with theoretical guarantees.",
            "Professor Dacheng Tao awarded by IEEE ICDM steering committee chair, Professor Xindong Wu in Singapore. \u201cI\u2019m now leading a team of early career researchers and research students to work on my ARC Laureate Fellowship. We aim to devise a suite of algorithms for processing and understanding videos captured by moving cameras, and to establish mathematical foundations for deep learning-based computer vision. \u201cThe project has already yielded considerable results \u2014 such as explaining why deep learning is superior to shallow learning and recovering depth information from a single RGB image.\". Rather than developing artificial intelligence to replace humans, Professor Tao instead believes its primary purpose is to augment the human experience, filling in gaps or performing tasks that humans are incapable of doing. \u201cMy team is working to ensure our developments will enhance humankind\u2019s capability, increase humans\u2019 productivity and improving our quality of life,\u201d says Professor Tao. \u201cAlready we have developed algorithms to track human pose from videos and thus to help robots mimic human\u2019s activities.\u201d. Having authored over five-hundred papers on such topics as machine intelligence, pattern analysis, and image processing, Professor Tao\u2019s work has also been cited over 36,000 times within both the fields of Engineering and Computer Science. Working with his fellow researchers and students, Professor Tao is adamant his recent achievement is the result of a group effort. \u201cI would like to extend sincere appreciations to my students, fellow researchers, collaborators and colleagues who have worked with me over the past years \u2013 this recent award just as much is about their work as it is mine,\u201d says Professor Tao."

            "George was born in Bathurst, a regional centre west of Sydney, in 1949 to newly-arrived immigrants from war-torn Europe who had instilled in him the value of a university education. He was encouraged to become an engineer as it was a valued profession in Europe. At school, George excelled in maths and science and his academic achievements led him to receive an Electricity Commission of New South Wales cadetship. At the time, the Commission was the State\u2019s monopoly supplier of energy and a dominant player in the energy space. Electing to study electrical engineering at the University of Sydney was a natural fit for the cadetship and his interests. \"I chose Sydney because it was Australia\u2019s oldest and best-known University,\" says George. Pivotal to George\u2019s career success was Sydney\u2019s learning tradition of nurturing a broad approach to intellectual training, compared to the narrower technical focus of other universities at the time. \"I took economics as my elective in my first year and developed a lifelong interest in this field and have found that it was highly complementary to engineering,\" he reflects. Studying at Sydney allowed George to pursue a wide range of interests, taught him much about leadership, and the experience was invaluable for his career. He has spent almost 20 years in public administration and counts his experience as the Editor of The Union Recorder as a stepping stone into university politics and the position of the Director of the Union Board which he held for several years.",
            "At university, George realised that, while his interests were grounded in the technical aspects of the energy industry, he was fascinated by how the industry worked, how the big decisions were made, how consumers behaved and the underlying political issues. These interests made the decision to leave the Electricity Commission and work at the (former) Energy Authority of NSW easier. At the time, the organisation was responsible for the regulation and technical, financial and economic coordination of the State\u2019s energy industries. A career highlight for George was his time as an Executive Director of Energy Australia. He successfully sought and achieved regulatory approval for one of Australia\u2019s largest capital programs aimed at the renewal of electricity transmission and distribution system in Sydney, Newcastle and the Hunter regions. Success wasn\u2019t only found in receiving the program, but in the reorganisation of the company as Managing Director to deliver the program amongst some controversy. \"I remember the Press running pictures of Ausgrid staff hosing down transformers on a hot day and railing about 'crumbling infrastructure',\" says George. \"Well, the system copes well on hot summer days now and at least some of the credit for that must go to my program of renewal.\". Leading Ausgrid to become the first utility in Australia to manage the large-scale introduction of time-based tariffs was another career highlight. Under George\u2019s direction, Ausgrid was able to overcome political and media scepticism and put some 450,000 customers on these tariffs, transforming behaviour with the aim of reducing the need to build capacity to meet demand on the hottest days. What many people don\u2019t know is that one of the biggest challenges for George involved mobilising the resources needed to deliver the rapidly scaled-up capital program.",
            "",
            "",
            "",
            "George sought support through innovative partnership arrangements with the private sector and the resolution of industrial issues with a heavily unionised workforce historically opposed to \u201ccontracting out\u201d. The huge construction footprint on the suburbs of Sydney and Newcastle also meant that new community engagement and communications techniques had to be developed to ensure the smooth delivery of the program. George was instrumental in the Commonwealth Government\u2019s internationally-significant Smart Grid/Smart City program designed to demonstrate a range of technologies to benefit the grid and consumers directly. The pioneering program included data and control analytics on the low voltage grid to facilitate the integration for distributed renewables as well as large scale deployment of smart meters enabling consumers to participate in critical peak pricing trials as well as direct demand response. George understood how important it was to ensure that the new infrastructure was compatible with future deployment of internet-enabled analytics and controls. Prior to joining Energy Australia, George was an Executive Director in the NSW Treasury and established a new framework for governance, strategic oversight and monitoring of the commercial operations of all state owned enterprises. He counts his time there as useful preparation for this future roles at Energy Australia/Ausgrid.",
            "In recent times, George has turned his attention to advocating for smart meters and technology-enabled services in Australia. The development of thought leadership initiatives has been an integral part of his work with Landis and Gyr, a global provider of smart meters, data management and data analytics. Coming full circle, George is now President of the Electrical and Information Engineering Foundation at the University, supporting the work of the School of Electrical and Information Engineering in promoting industry engagement, awarding academic prizes and scholarships and organising relevant events. Active in research development, George is also involved with a project which aims at using phase change materials (such as hydrated salts) to store heat or cool. This is the equivalent of a thermal battery, where domestic air conditioners can be \u201ccharged\u201d using rooftop PV to run the air conditioning system when the PV output is available. Looking to the future of the industry George is hopeful. \u201cThe innovations made possible by combining modern communications technology with traditional energy infrastructure and new distributed energy sources like photovoltaics will fundamentally change the energy industry,\" says George. \"Power, together with information, is beginning to flow both ways and consumers are increasingly becoming the generators. Energy storage will further revolutionise the power system as there will be no need for instantaneous balance between generation and load to be the dominant driver of the energy market.\u201d."

            "Professor Itai Einav and Dr Francois Guillard conducting experiments with puffed rice cereal. Did you know that highly-porous, brittle and soft, puffed cereal grains share similar properties to varieties of rocks and dry snow?. It\u2019s an observation not lost on Professor Itai Einav and Dr Francois Guillard from the Sydney Centre in Geomechanics and Mining Materials (SciGEM), who are using cereal to effectively model how similar materials behave when exposed to various conditions. To date, the self-monikered \u201ccereal killers\u201d have utilised the breakfast favourite to examine the movement and crushing of brittle, porous materials when compressed and their properties when introduced to fluids. \u201cPuffed rice is just one example of brittle porous media,\u201d explains Professor Einav, Director of SciGEM. \u201cAside from cereal, brittle porous media also include rocks and dry snow, as well as manufactured lightweight porous concretes and foams used as heat insulators and shock absorbers. \u201cThe lower strength of puffed rice allows us to conduct scaled down experiments at an accelerated rate in our laboratories \u2013 something that would be logistically impossible to do with 100 metre-high actual rock!\u201d.",
            "Snap: The crushing of porous materials. In 2015, Professor Einav and Dr Guillard led an international collaboration including researchers from San Diego State University to research the movement and crushing of porous materials when compressed using the puffed rice cereal. Their findings, published in journal Nature Physics, shed new light on understanding such phenomena as snowballs colliding during avalanches and crater patterns formed during meteorite impacts. \u201cWe knew that brittle, porous materials exhibit irreversible compaction patterns, but not in what ways they move and deform, or the types of internal patterns that develop,\u201d explains Professor Einav. \u201cPuffed rice cereal was selected as we wanted to understand how packs of brittle grains coordinate motion when crushed. This simple experiment revealed surprisingly rich compaction patterns that were due to the competing processes of internal collapse and recovery. \u201cThese different patterns of compaction can be useful to rationalise the behaviour of brittle, porous media such as sandstone, volcanic ashes and manufactured materials like metallic foams.\u201d.",
            "Crackle: The mechanics of strain-rate softening. The geomechanical engineers soon expanded on their previous work to determine the mechanical response of using puffed rice cereal, in particular how it reacts when the compaction velocity is changed. What they discovered in this series of experiments proved surprising and documented in depth in a 2017 edition of Physical Review Letters. \u201cMost material would get stronger the faster you press on them but puffed rice is an exception \u2013 it actually gets softer,\u201d notes Dr Guillard. \u201cThis is a phenomenon called \u2018strain-rate softening\u2019 and demonstrated instabilities and compaction bands similar to those previously observed in metals. \u201cA good understanding of how instability develops in any material is crucial to trying to prevent their occurrence if possible. \u201cAlthough we studied only a particular class of material in the guise of brittle, porous media, we believe the conclusion we drew could be translated to a much wider range of materials.\u201d. By understanding the role of strain-rate softening on the motion of puffed rice, the researchers hope to improve the understanding of instabilities in other materials that exhibit strain-rate softening, such as stick-slip phenomena that are know to control earthquake dynamics.",

            "Pop: Unearthing ricequakes. Anyone who loves Kellogg's Rice Bubbles knows that cereal grains crush under load or become soggy in fluid over time. But what happens when they are both loaded and soaked at the same time?. This was the premise of the pair\u2019s recent 2018 paper in Science Advances, which revealed the discovery of \u2018ricequakes\u2019: the sudden collapses of columns of wetted puffed rice that produce perpetual clicking sounds akin to a slowing metronome. \u201cWe\u2019ve happily studied dry puffed rice so adding milk seemed the most logical extension of our research,\u201d says Professor Einav. \u201cWe used milk, skim milk and water, and always got essentially the same result \u2013 the sounds of \u2018ricequakes\u2019.\u201d. Scientifically, a \u2018ricequake\u2019 happens when the fluid reacts with the sufficient amount of time to weaken the supporting structure to a point where it will no longer hold the top stress without collapsing internally. Collapses in sinkholes, ice shelves and rockfill dams involve brittle porous media, which can weaken under the action of wetting-induced degradation by chemically active fluid. In showing that their model for puffed rice and milk can explain \u2018ricequakes\u2019, the researchers have opened the doors for better predictions of icequakes in Antarctica, or collapse of rockfill in high embankment dams. \u201cFascinatingly, the dynamics of recurring \u2018ricequakes\u2019 we found in cereal are quite reminiscent to recurring tidal icequake dynamics in Antarctica!,\u201d says Professor Einav.",

What\u2019s next for these engineering \u201ccereal killers\u201d?. \u201cThere\u2019s geophysics everywhere in our breakfast,\u201d says Professor Einav. \u201cOur focus is on using puffed rice as a model of rocks and snows, but that\u2019s not to ignore the idea of constructing a model for the folding of ductile rocks using stacks of waffles or pancakes, or heating porridge to model for mantle convection.\u201d."

            "Rebecca Ryan Bachelor of Project Management student. What was your capstone unit?. All project management students complete a capstone unit during their final year which runs through both semesters. It provides students with the opportunity to successfully initiate, plan, executive, control and close a real life project based on the skills learnt during the first two years of study. As part of the capstone unit, we formed groups to deliver this project as a team. What was your project?. My project was known as 'Project Connect' and our brief was to \"plan and deliver a pop-up space to drive social connection between staff members on campus\". My group consisted of seven students and we were under the guidance of our academic director. Our client was the Cultural Strategy Team at the University of Sydney. We named our Project 'USYD Creative\". At the beginning of 2020, there were many challenges considering COVID was becoming a real barrier for delivering this project. We worked with the client and identified that there was an opportunity to bring people together \u2013 particularly now as people were lacking social and physical connections. The proposed solution was a pop-up immersive art experience held on campus for three days coupled with a virtual aspect to accommodate staff and students working from home. The event consisted of three large canvases, which posed three questions prompting the users to reflect on the year of 2020. What have you learnt through this project?. I have learnt a lot about myself during this project. Teamwork is a major aspect of project management and I think it is important to establish a leadership style. I was team leader so I was responsible for getting items delivered to the client on time. I learnt a lot about team dynamics and how to manage the team to get efficient results. I think you learn a lot of theory at University which is why the capstone unit is so significant as it is a real life project, with a schedule and budget you must follow. In a project management career, there is definitely going to be some obstacles during projects, hence learning how to navigate this project during COVID has provided us the necessary skills to overcome barriers.",
            "Karlo Karlovic Bachelor of Advanced Computing student. What was your capstone unit?. For our Information Systems capstone unit ( ISYS3888 ), we completed \u2018CS36 - Improving Access to Regulatory Safety Warnings on Medicines - Creation of a searchable Database\u2019. What was your project?. Our project was a 'one-stop-shop' for all drug warnings and advisories. After a drug is made, it undergoes many extensive tests to ensure its safety for use. However, once it is released to the public there is no easy way for medical professionals and users of a drug to find out any newly found impacts of the drug. Some of these impacts can only be found after five, ten, or even 15 years after the drug was first released. It is therefore vital that people who have and are currently using it are aware of these adverse health effects. We aimed to centralise this information and working with the Charles Perkins Centre (CPC) to create this online database provided us with the ability to transfer our well-developed technical skills into a real-world issue. The team at the CPC provided us with great domain knowledge and professional guidance. The first thing we completed was to establish a clear scope of work with the client, which included gathering further requirements not specified in the initial document. This was to provide a clear expectation of what the final prototype would look like. Once this baseline was established, we worked on an iterative design phase to figure out the design and functionally of the prototype. We then worked on implementing the frontend and backend code that would be required to implement the requirements. The most difficult task was importing all the original data into our newly designed database schema. Throughout development, we would continuously update our live site so our client and associates could review development and changes, providing them the ability to make new suggestions and tweaks. This occurred iteratively over multiple weeks until we came to the final prototype for handover. We believe we met the initial set of requirements as the client is now looking for ways to use this initial codebase for future use in their original project purpose. What have you learned through this project?. Our team had to learn a lot in order to complete this project including learning new frameworks to support the site, registering and hosting a domain, and running routine server maintenance. Working with representatives from the Charles Perkins Centre was an extremely rewarding experience. They provided us a real sense of purpose and direction that wasn\u2019t only technically related, but also socially and culturally. This project exposed to our group what it meant to work in a team and how the \u2018real\u2019 world works in a now online environment.",
            "Aakanksha Bose Master of Data Science student. What was your capstone unit?. DATA5703: Data Science Capstone Project. What was your project?. Our project was predicting the price of electricity in the National Electricity Market (NEM) and building a dashboard for live pricing predictions. One of our team members works in the energy industry and presented a problem that interested us all. Though COVID-19 presented its challenges, we ensured to always sync up as a team and check-in with one another. Our industry partner Infigen Energy was very happy with the solutions and end product we created and found that it will add benefit to the processes they are already undertaking. What have you learned through this project?. We were fortunate enough to partner with Infigen Energy. They were solving a particular problem and our team assisted in reaching their desired outcome and solution. Having never had any experience in the energy market, I learnt a great deal about the processes and strategies applied in pricing/the interconnected dependencies between each state. It was also very interesting to see that 24/7 monitoring is required for resources and the underlying differences between each state\u2019s electricity needs and the corresponding price. This project allowed us to work on a real-world problem, where the final outcome may not have been necessarily known. In many of the subjects completed throughout the Master of Data Science, most of the datasets have been explored extensively and the process explicitly defined. Working on this project allowed us to map out the project pipeline from start to finish, which will be invaluable when we carry out projects in our respective careers. It also gave us the opportunity to explore models and libraries, which we may not have considered previously. In addition to building our technical skills, it was a chance to enhance soft skills such as communication and stakeholder management. It showed us the importance of taking a complex problem but also presenting it in a way that the everyday user can also understand.",

The primary goal of her research is to relate residual-stresses, mechanical and metallurgical properties to manufacturing procedures and integrity requirements of engineering components. \u201cI am delighted with this peer recognition as it is a fantastic feeling to know that my research contributions are being seen and appreciated by the community,\u201d said Professor Paradowska, a co-appointed Professor Practice between the School of Civil Engineering and ANSTO. \u201cNeutron scattering has an enormous potential to help solve range of industry problems, and the full potential of those various method is yet to be discovered by the industry.\u201d. The award is the latest achievement for the international expert in neutron diffraction stress analysis, having previously been named recipient of the ASM Henry Marion Howe Medal for co-authoring materials paper In Situ Study of the Stress Relaxation During Aging of Nickel-Base Superalloy Forgings. The ASM Henry Marion Howe Medal is a prestigious prize intended to honour the author(s) whose paper has been selected as the best of those published in a specific volume of Metallurgical and Materials Transactions. As part of the project, Paradowska measured residual stresses in the superalloys during in situ heat treatments on the Kowari strain scanner and the same procedure was repeated at other neutron facilities. The results demonstrated that the newly-developed induction heating setup could be repeated successfully on several instruments across three continents and reassure the scientific and industrial community that residual stress relaxation can be measured accurately and systematically.

            "The idea that a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazonian jungle may lead to a tornado in Texas sounds strange. And yet this concept, known as \u2018the butterfly effect\u2019 is commonly used to describe the behaviour of complex systems. At their core, complex systems comprise a number of large diverse interacting agents, including humans (society), animals or microorganisms (ecosystem), neurons (brain) and substations or sensors (power grids). When in the presence of external shocks and stresses, these interactions can often create unexpected, large-scale, and apparently unpredictable behaviours. For example, a single malfunction in a local substation can lead to cascading state-wide electricity grid failures, while the emergence of a new virus in a remote location can give rise to a devastating global pandemic. As the only degree of its kind in the southern hemisphere, our Master of Complex Systems has been developed to equip professionals with skills to deal with the complex challenges posed by our interconnected world and rapidly changing technology, such as pandemics, climate change, population growth, and security. The degree has been designed following consultations with international and Australian industrial and health security leaders. It provides the necessary expertise to model, analyse and design resilient technological, socio-economic and socio-ecological systems as well as skills to develop optimal strategies for crisis prevention, forecasting and management. We caught up with current students Natalie and Katya, and graduates Mike and Sooraj to find out why they have chosen to further their careers with a Master of Complex Systems.",
            "What attracted you to the Master of Complex Systems?. I was looking for a program that would equip me with strong data handling and analysis skills and I was instantly fascinated by the field of complex systems when I stumbled across it.

How will the Master of Complex Systems set you up for the career of your choice?. I am happy to guide my studies towards my interests while continuing to build my skills in coding, machine learning and analysis. Studying in the Master of Complex Systems has honed my existing skills in a more formal and technical way, and expanded my understanding of how to ask questions and approach problems in data.",
            "What attracted you to the Master of Complex Systems?. I was attracted to the Master of Complex Systems program primarily due to its transdisciplinary nature and emphasis on analytical skills with real-world applicability. I hoped that participation in this program would not only facilitate the development of strong mathematical, data management, and research skills, but also afford the opportunity to explore domain-specific applications through the selection of a specialisation. How has your previous industry experience complemented what you are currently studying in the Master of Complex Systems?. My previous degree in cognitive systems from the University of British Columbia provided excellent theoretical foundations in areas such as social psychology, systems theory, and game theory, which have proven to be very useful in contextualising the mathematical materials presented in my complex systems coursework. Most of all, both work and study with the cognitive systems program has afforded disciplinary flexibility and the ability to draw inferences across many fields. How will the Master of Complex Systems set you up for the career of your choice?. I am very interested in social-ecological systems and eusocial insects; upon graduation, I hope to apply my skills in the fields of sustainability or agroecology, particularly in the areas of beekeeping, food security, and ecological and supply chain resilience.",
            "What attracted you to the Master of Complex Systems?. I found the topic of complex systems to be a fascinating and it provided me with a new way of looking at a lot of familiar disciplines in a new light. The range of specialisations within the degree demonstrated that complex systems as a whole could be applied to a variety of different areas. It also offered me with a way to combine my science and commerce backgrounds. How did your previous industry experience complement what you were studied in the Master of Complex Systems?. I previously worked in inbound marketing and business analysis for several start-ups and small businesses. This experience helped me to consider the applications of what was taught towards business and organisational systems. I was also able to pursue several research projects during my degree with organisations such as CSIRO, which complemented my previous research experiences as a physics honours undergraduate. What career are you now working in and how did the Master of Complex Systems assist in setting you up for this job/industry choice?. I am now a data scientist and can confidently attribute the Masters of Complex Systems with helping to develop my range of technical abilities including data processing, programming skills and visualisation.",
            "What attracted you to the Master of Complex Systems?. I was recommended the complex systems program by a research supervisor at a laboratory I worked at after completing my Bachelor of Science degree. I graduated specialising in geophysics and remote sensing but really enjoyed building maps and seeing the neighbourhood interactions between organisations, people and nature in a spatial context. How did your previous industry experience complement what you were studied in the Master of Complex Systems?. Coming from a research background, I elected to study the Research Methods specialisation so I could both work on what I was interested in and understand academic research better. I undertook many research units as part of the course, and I was even able to get my research published with the support of the complex systems researchers. What career are you now working in and how did the Master of Complex Systems assist in setting you up for this job/industry choice?. I am interested in furthering my career in research administration which will allow me to draw upon my respective backgrounds in complex systems as well as cartography. The degree also provided me with a new perspective on how to approach things and an analytical mindset to question the underlying properties which leads to observed phenomena."

            "Advancements in space exploration and space travel has come leaps and bounds since humankind first gazed upwards to the stars. Since the successful space launch of the first artificial satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957, humans have set foot on the moon, built a dedicated space residency in the guise of the International Space Station, and launched numerous satellites and robotic spacecraft to journey and collect valuable data about the sun, our neighbouring planets and other interstellar bodies. The next several decades are expected to feature humans making their return to the moon as well as setting foot on (and potentially colonising) the planet Mars. As Australia\u2019s only dedicated undergraduate space engineering degree, our Bachelor of Engineering Honours with Space Engineering is designed to equip the next generation of space engineers with the technical skills and knowledge needed to be involved in these feats and ultimately leave their mark on an industry sector projected to be worth US$558 billion by 2026 (1). \u201cOur Bachelor of Honours with Space Engineering is the only degree of it\u2019s kind in Australia, providing students with a program that covers all space-related activities, from ground operations to the design and construction of orbital bodies and explorative spacecraft,\u201d explains Dr Xiaofeng Wu. \u201cOur students learn about the many facets that make up space engineering, including orbital mechanics, space vehicles and ground station infrastructure, space avionics and space robotics. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed the curriculum so that students are taught the theory of each unit area and given many valuable hands-on opportunities to apply their learnings and solve solutions to diverse space engineering challenges.\u201d. Examples of these challenges include: designing optimal satellite orbits and spacecraft mechanics, working in teams to construct a complete satellite system, developing space robotic systems, and, designing control software on a satellite simulator.",
            "Our student-driven USYD Rocketry Team made history by winning the 10,000 feet commercial off-the-shelf category at the Spaceport America Cup in 2019. Students studying space engineering also have opportunities to ply their knowledge and compete internationally in rocket-building and satellite-launching competitions by joining the student-driven USYD Rocketry Team. In 2019, they made history by becoming the first Australian team to travel to the USA and compete in the Spaceport America Cup, winning the 10,000 feet commercial off-the-shelf category in their first attempt. Students studying any of our Bachelor of Engineering Honours streams including space engineering are also taught enhanced foundation studies in data and computation so they are best positioned to engineer for the digital age. \u201cAs a rapidly advancing and innovative field, the knowledge and experiences our space engineering students gain over the course of their degree with us will equip them for an exciting career across the aerospace, defence, environmental and research industries,\u201d says Dr Wu. \u201cIt is the ideal undergraduate degree for those students wanting to someday work overseas for international space agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) or the European Space Agency (ESA), or even emerging private space firms such as Space-X or Virgin Galactic. \u201cGraduating space engineers can now also opt to remain closer to home, either by working for the Australian Space Agency, or securing one of the 12,000 highly skilled jobs to be created by the Australian Government and Australian private sector, including Myriota, Fleet Space, Inovor Technologies, Gilmour Space, to meet its goal of tripling the national space economy to $12 billion by 2030. \u201cWhatever their career path, this program provides our students with the tools needed to design and build the infrastructure or interplanetary spacecraft of the future \u2013 even those that have yet to be conceived.\u201d. The University of Sydney\u2019s Bachelor of Engineering Honours with Space Engineering degree is available to undergraduate students enrolled in our aeronautical engineering, mechanical engineering or mechatronic engineering streams who meet eligibility requirements.

            "Since her undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering (Bachelor of Engineering, Mechanical Engineering \u201893) at the University of Sydney, Jane MacMaster has had an impressive accolade of achievements on top of a successful career. She was most recently appointed Chief Engineer at Engineers Australia, where she will lead the organisation\u2019s engagement with industry, government and academia. We spoke to Jane about how her choice to study mechanical engineering led her to where she is today \u2013 and the many lessons she\u2019s gleaned along the way.",
            "Why did you choose a career in mechanical engineering?. Well, to be honest, I didn\u2019t to begin with. I really didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do, or what I wanted to study when I left school. My first list of course preferences didn\u2019t include engineering, mainly because I didn\u2019t really know what engineers \u2018did\u2019. During an interview with someone from the University of Sydney, the interviewer picked up on my love of maths and sciences and suggested I consider engineering. Decision made.",
            "Jane and her engineering classmates. What is your favourite USYD memory?. This was a tough question to answer because there isn\u2019t just one! My favourite awe-inspiring memory is being in the Great Hall (for exams, unfortunately) in the Quad \u2013 amazing. My favourite \u2018fun\u2019 experience is all the engineering get-togethers, especially on Friday afternoons and the annual revues. My favourite subject was system dynamics. But most of all I appreciated the people. Nearly 30 years after graduating I\u2019m still in contact with many of my fellow engineering students and quite a few of the engineering faculty staff. How did your uni degree contribute to your career \u2013 especially early on?. My engineering degree has been fundamental to everything I\u2019ve done in my career. It was really the springboard for everything I\u2019ve done since 1993. It turns out that people like the way engineers think \u2013 we typically think in quite a structured way, with an emphasis on logic and we tend to adopt a \u2018systems\u2019 approach to things. That skill set and mindset is very transferrable, so an engineering degree is a versatile and valued qualification to have.",
            "Jane with her favourite aircraft. Can you share a career highlight?. Two years after graduating, I was lucky enough to be offered a job with British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) in Melbourne. The position was Thermal Design Engineer for a supersonic flight vehicle (Evolved SeaSparrow Missile system) that provided defence for ships against inbound threats. It was a NATO project and Australia was a guest nation for the project. We had responsibility for designing four sub-systems \u2013 the thrust vector controller, the aerodynamic control fins, the dorsal fins and the guidance control algorithms. That project remains the most formative of my career because the teams I worked with (both Australian and international teams) were incredible \u2013 talented and fun. I worked on the project from beginning to end \u2013 almost from a \u2018blank sheet of paper\u2019 to the production phase. That is an incredibly valuable learning experience \u2013 to see what is required to get a very complicated system from literally an \u2018artist\u2019s impression\u2019 through to a functioning system onboard ships. That project was where I \u2018grew up\u2019 as an engineer and I\u2019ll be forever grateful for the team I worked with during that time for the opportunities and mentoring I was given. What I learnt about a good design process on that project has informed everything I\u2019ve done since. How would you describe the trajectory of your career?.",
            "My career has taken a few unexpected turns and I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work in a range of industries and sectors, all of them drawing on my engineering training and experience. I\u2019ve found the varied experience to be valuable because I\u2019ve learnt different ways of thinking and doing things in each of them. When you bring them all together it provides a bigger pool of ideas to draw on when encountering new challenges. That\u2019s definitely been the greatest benefit of having had a varied career. There was no plan for doing that. I\u2019ve never really had a grand plan for my career, and while it\u2019s great to have a plan, especially if you know what you want \u2018to do\u2019, it\u2019s also beneficial to build in flexibility to that plan so you can accommodate new opportunities (and challenges) as they arise. The changes in my career have either been because an opportunity arose and I took it, or, in the case of starting my own business, because I felt strongly that there was a gap that I could help fill. As it turns out despite the range of roles, industries and sectors I\u2019ve worked in, I\u2019ve woven together a theme from them. I wove all my experiences together to form a generalised model for problem-solving, strategy and design for complex challenges. It draws heavily on engineering principles and techniques but also builds in ideas from other areas such as complexity science, behavioural insights, theory of strategy, general systems theory and others.",
            "Jane working at BAE Systems. What is your advice to current engineering students? Especially after COVID?. The pandemic has certainly thrown us all a few challenges. I would suggest focusing now on learning, both through your university work and any work experience you may have access to, whether that\u2019s engineering-related or another part-time job (because all work experience is valuable). If you have time up your sleeve. consider taking some online short courses, explore whether there are some companies that offer virtual internships, think about working with a mentor, talk to your Faculty/School about work experience or mentoring opportunities with industry (and consider this prior to your final year), and join some communities of practice or volunteering work. Any of these initiatives will help build your knowledge, experience and networks. You might also consider joining Engineers Australia, the largest association representing engineers in the country (and where I now work as Chief Engineer). Student membership is free and is designed to help students engage in the profession and build the skills needed to become a well-rounded professional.",
            "Jane at work experience in Kalimantan. What advice do you have for budding female engineers?. The biggest challenge I had throughout my career was that I had low confidence and conviction in my ideas, probably until I reached my early 40\u2019s. Now, in my (very!) late 40s, I have much more confidence and conviction in my ideas and I\u2019m comfortable talking with just about anyone, but goodness it took a long time to get to this point. I\u2019m sure not every female engineer has low confidence like I did, but if you do, I would just remind you that asking questions, even if you don\u2019t know the answer, is extremely valuable, because it encourages people to think about a valid point that you\u2019ve just raised. There is growing recognition of the value of diversity in thought, so try to contribute to discussions when you can. And don\u2019t be afraid of saying something \u2018stupid\u2019 or asking \u2018silly questions\u2019. Goodness knows I\u2019ve said things or asked questions which seem obvious to everyone else many times in the past, and so has everyone else by the way, and that\u2019s just part of learning. The more you learn, the more valuable your insights will become over time."

            "During the peak of COVID-19 in Australia, NSW Health put out a call to universities and industry to help design a ventilator that was low-cost and able to be manufactured locally. Professor Gregg Suaning from the School of Biomedical Engineering responded to this call and recruited a team of researchers and students to create a solution. The first prototype, CoVida FC100, was successfully built in April. The team are currently manufacturing more models for further clinical assessment and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval.",
            "The CoVida project showcases the incredible work that is enabled by the University\u2019s industry and government partnerships. It also sheds light on the types of real-life opportunities our students have access to \u2013 even in the midst of a global pandemic. Members of the team included current students Jared Bergman, Claire Bridges and Daniel Landro who share their experience on the project.",
            "Daniel Landro. Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Biomedical) and Bachelor of Medical Science. A final year Biomedical Engineering and Medical Science student, Daniel Landro responded to Professor Gregg Suaning\u2019s \u2018call to arms\u2019 because he knew it was time to do his part and make a difference. What was your role on the project?. I have been working closely with the team to coordinate the mechanical engineering component of the project, focusing on reverse engineering existing designs and engaging NSW-based manufacturers to produce prototype assemblies. The mechanical team would generate 3D models of various components and assemblies and prototype them using 3D printing technology in the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering Fabrication Laboratory. We would then work with manufacturers to produce functional prototypes. There is a long list of volunteers who did a lot of the hard work and made my role significantly easier, this really was a team effort. What have you gained from this experience?. This project was a deep dive into a real, urgent public health problem that tested every lesson I had learned throughout my five years at university. It challenged and developed my capacity for project management, leadership and problem solving yet reaffirmed my desire to make a difference as a biomedical engineer. I am proud of the work that our team has produced in response to the crisis and have learned a lot from the experience.",
            "Claire Bridges. PhD candidate. Claire Bridges undertook units from the Faculty of Engineering in 2014 as a study abroad student before later returning to complete a Master of Nursing and Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Engineering. She is currently completing her PhD in cell-based therapies for diabetes under the supervision of Professor Peter Thorn. This project is close to Claire's heart \u2013 a registered nurse herself and also engaged to an ICU nurse, Claire knew what healthcare workers would face if a lack of equipment became reality. It was important to her to prevent this and provide for the health workforce. What was your role on the project?. I have been helping with the administration/external engagement side of the project \u2013 while we were all isolating in our homes, my goal was to keep volunteers engaged and to connect with groups outside of the University who were interested in what the team was creating. I\u2019ve been fortunate to work with people to create our website, liaise with media groups, and try to promote the project as much as possible. What have you gained from this experience?. It\u2019s always great to learn from academics and industry professionals who are involved in the project \u2013 they know so much and can see applications of the theory we get taught as students, and provide insight to how best to take our learned knowledge and turn it into something useful for the real world. I have definitely become more practiced at managing a group of people, delegating tasks and asking for contributions from people who are great in their fields. One of the most beneficial things to any project is collaboration from different backgrounds, and seeing clinicians, engineers, and students from all kinds of backgrounds come together has really highlighted the best ways to engage and connect with people. A second project focusing on creating and providing PPE to clinicians has grown out of the ventilator project, and I was fortunate enough to be asked to be part of that team as well. It\u2019s been a great opportunity to combine my clinical experience with my love of designing, improving, and building products, with a project-management element.",
            "Jared Bergman. Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Biomedical) and Bachelor of Medical Science. Jared Bergman, a fifth and final year Biomedical Engineering and Medical Science student put his hand up for this project because he was motivated by the immediate need for ventilators globally. Whist the worst is over in Australia, this project will be crucial for facing future pandemics and other countries that are still battling to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019. What was your role on the project?. I had multiple roles in this project. One role was working with the mechanical team by computer-aided design (CAD) modelling and 3D printing pneumatic components, as well as prototyping valves for these components. Another role was working with the industrial design team in designing the user interface. I focussed on gathering information on existing systems, drafting user interface designs and working with other team members on developing the prototype enclosure for the ventilator. This was an iterative process which prioritised functionality and simplicity. This involved working closely with our resident clinician Dr Ken Harrison from CareFlight, as well as the mechanical and electrical teams to ensure all parts came together correctly. What have you gained from this experience?. Working alongside students and staff from other faculties was a great experience since we were all working towards a common objective and trying to utilise whatever resources or skills we could. For example, students and lecturers from the School of Chemistry with past experience in industrial design were volunteering their spare time and dusting off old skills to help on the development of components like the housing prototype. This project has helped me develop my knowledge of current skills like CAD modelling and 3D printing. I know much more about pneumatics and mechanical design than I did previously. Working with the industrial design team taught me new skills and showed me what it was like to work outside the field of biomedical engineering. I was taught the steps and stages needed to develop a product from more than just an engineering point of view and enjoyed learning something different. Working with other teams on a high stress project with limited time and resources meant teamwork, leadership and communication skills were crucial to making progress and ensuring all aspects of the project came together. I think these have been the most valuable skills I was able to develop over the course of this project."

            "Engineering alumnus Dr Phillip N.H. Smith. It is with great sadness that we record the passing of alumnus Dr Phillip Noel Hartley Smith (BE(Mining&Metallurgy) \u201950 DEng \u201997) who died peacefully in his Pennsylvania home on Friday 20 March 2020, aged 94. Born in Sydney in 1926, Dr Smith served in the Merchant Navy in World War II before beginning his studies in Mining and Metallurgy at the University of Sydney in the late 1940s. A rower for Wesley College, his love of serving his community also saw him heavily involved in the Palm Beach Lifesaving Club during his student days. After graduating with First Class Honours, he travelled Australia surveying mine sites before receiving a Fulbright Scholarship to complete graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From there, Dr Smith moved to Illinois to work at Inland Steel in Chicago. It was at this point he was awarded the US National Steel Award for an academic paper he co-wrote. His career in steel subsequently went from strength to strength as he moved into business and executive roles, eventually becoming President and CEO of the Ohio-based Copperweld Corporation in 1967 and President of North American operations of the Bekaert Group in 1977. Having taken some management studies in his student days, Dr Smith continued to display his trademark generosity serving as guest lecturer and adjunct faculty member at various US and Chinese universities. In recognition of his significant contributions to engineering, Dr Smith was awarded with a Doctor of Engineering (honoris causa) from the University in 1997. In presenting Dr Smith for admission to this honorary degree, the then Vice-Chancellor and Principal Professor Donald McNicol said: \u201cHe is one of those rare people who reverse Parkinson's Law that work expands to fill the time available by making time expand to accommodate a great number of worthwhile activities. \"He has a great concern for the welfare of society and ethical activities. For good causes he gives generously of his time and skills in raising funds.\u201d. Combining his generosity and strong connection to his alma mater, Dr Smith founded the University of Sydney USA Foundation so alumni and friends could make philanthropic contributions to the University from the US and devoted his time readily to the Sydney University Graduates Union of North America (SUGUNA). The Phillip Noel Hartley Smith Distinguished Honours Scholarship in the Business School will continue his legacy of support. A kind and keen member of the University community, he will be missed by many. Dr Smith is survived by his wife, Martha; five daughters; 11 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by a son and grandson."

Although widely recommended by health professionals for the symptomatic relief of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions, current probiotics experience a significant loss in viability due to the acidic environment of the stomach. A University of Sydney research team led by School of Chemical and Bimolecular Engineering academic Professor Fariba Dehghani aims to develop a system that mitigates the effects of gastro-intestinal system on the probiotics. \u201cWe hope the research will lead to an increased understanding of the factors affecting the viability of probiotics during both storage and passage through the gastro-intestinal tract, the establishment of probiotics into gut flora, and how this incorporation affects the dynamics of gut microbiota,\u201d said Professor Dehghani, Director of the Centre for Advanced Food Enginomics. The project will generate the next generation of probiotics products and seeks to improve the competitiveness of the Australian probiotics industry. \u201cThe acidic environment of the stomach can deplete the number of live probiotics reaching the colon,\" said Associate Professor Aaron Schindeler, a collaborator who will be conducting preclinical trials. \"Technology from Professor Dehghani\u2019s team aims to protect probiotics in the stomach and target them to the colon through the design of a new method for colon targeted probiotic delivery.\u201d.

Combining sport with study.",
            "Jill Colebourn shooting at a competition in Poland. Biathlon, a winter sport where athletes compete in both cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, was not the obvious choice for Jill, who lived in Sydney hours away from the closest ski field. \u201cIt was a really big commitment, as my parents were driving me six hours one way every weekend to ski,\u201d says Jill. \u201cI don\u2019t think every parent would agree to do it, but they did, and I\u2019m really lucky.\u201d. It paid off \u2013 at the end of 2019, Jill competed at the biathlon World Cup, achieving a personal best and becoming the first Australian woman in over 20 years compete. \u201cI was just excited to get out there and do what I love at the highest level,\u201d shares Jill, close to two months after her amazing achievement. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Jill also had to balance her burgeoning career as a biathlete with her increasing workload as an engineering and commerce student. \u201cI am a recipient of an Sydney University Elite Athlete Program scholarship for my sporting endeavours,\u201d Jill adds, a program that helped her balance sport and study, along with the support of her teachers and supervisors within the Faculty of Engineering. \u201cIt was amazing to see Jill balance the demands of her training schedule against her commitment to her studies,\u201d says Professor Stefan Williams, who supervised Jill\u2019s undergraduate thesis project. \u201cWe were very proud to hear about her performance at the recent biathlon world championships.\u201d. Academic and industry achievements. Jill\u2019s achievements go further than her prowess on the ski fields. She was awarded an Engineering Sydney Industry Placement Scholarship (ESIPS), designed to give the highest-achieving students valuable industry experience at top engineering companies. As an ESIPS recipient, Jill underwent an internship at multinational services company Accenture Australia. \u201cThe ESIPS program was the most incredible internship opportunity, and I am immensely grateful. I was able to gain real work experience at Accenture, one of the world\u2019s leading consulting firms, while completing my honours thesis and gaining credits towards my engineering degree,\u201d says Jill. She has continued to work for Accenture while competing as a biathlete, adding that the global nature of the business has helped her immensely. \u201cJillian did a great job of her thesis. She investigated new machine learning models for predicting failures in complex computer systems,\u201d says Professor Williams. Jill was also a recipient of the Muriel Anderson Scholarship for Engineering in 2014, the first year of her degree, which recognises outstanding female engineering students beginning their studies. It cemented a love for engineering that began early on in her life. \u201cAt high school, my favourite subjects were maths and design and technology, but what first drew me to engineering was the idea of creating something from nothing. I still love the opportunity to be creative and actually make or build something,\u201d says Jill. Looking to the future.",
            "Jill competing in Poland. With the biathlon season well underway, Jill shows no signs of slowing down. Having made history in 2019, she\u2019s looking ahead. \u201cThe day after my World Cup debut, I achieved a new personal best, which re-qualified me for the World Cup circuit this year,\u201d says Jill, fresh from another effort competing at the World Championships last week and with plenty of events still to come. Jill has headed for an overseas exchange in Milan Italy at Bocconi University for the first semester of this year to further her engineering and commerce degree \u2013 and possibly prepare for an Olympics berth. \u201cI see myself working with Accenture for the near-future as a software engineer while also balancing my athletic commitments and Olympic goals. This helps me keep my technical skills up to-date while I pursue sport so that I am fully prepared for work as an engineer when I finish my sporting career,\u201d adds Jill. At only 25 years old, it seems certain that Jill\u2019s achievements will continue, thanks to a fierce determination to succeed. \u201cMy best asset is my strength of will,\u201d says Jill. \u201cI never give up.\u201d."

            "Alana, far right, with her fellow chemical engineering alumni at her graduation. Alana Newbrook\u2019s role as a general manager at a consulting firm might not at first appear to be the traditional role an engineering graduate would take on. But it\u2019s a path that\u2019s becoming increasingly common, as engineering and project management roles begin to cross industry lines. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you would classify as traditional these days, but I like to think of my career path as one that has offered me the best challenges and allowed me to grow,\u201d says Alana. Alana studied chemical engineering at the University of Sydney, graduating in 2004 with fond memories of her time here. \u201cUniversity was a great experience both for learning and meeting lifelong friends. Graduating in the Great Hall was certainly a highlight!\u201d. She took with her a set of key technical skills that would inform her career in STEM, as well as project management and risk assessment capabilities. \u201cMy engineering degree has been the solid foundation for me to explore a multitude of different experiences; from small jobs, mega projects, design, construction, commercial, financial and legal aspects. It ensured I had a core set of skills to fall back on, and opened any door I have wanted to walk through.\u201d. After graduation, Alana took up a position with Caltex, and from there moved to a role in a small petrochemical consulting company. It was here she got a taste for project management on a large scale, inspiring her to undergo further study by way of an MBA. Now, as the general manager at WSP, a management and consultancy services firm, Alana leads a team of over 200 people in providing technical advice to clients in the public and private sectors.",
            "Alana Newbrook. \u201cI oversee a large team who help clients to plan, finance, deliver and maintain some of Australia\u2019s biggest infrastructure,\" says Alana, having recently re-joined WSP having previously worked there early in her career. \"Looking ahead at an uncertain future means WSP is committed to being future-ready.\u201d. In taking on the role as general manager of WSP\u2019s Advisory Team, Alana utilises her engineering expertise to provide clients with strategic and technical advice. \u201cOur team partner with clients through the infrastructure lifecycle, solving challenges around strategy, policy, planning, investment decision making, performance, governance and asset management,\u201d she adds. Alana\u2019s achievements are made more significant by the fact that she has forged a career across industries that have historically been male-dominated. Far from seeing this as a barrier, Alana attributes part of her success to being a \u2018minority\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a positive point of difference. It\u2019s given me exposure to all sorts of experiences and allowed me to be a different voice at the table,\u201d she says. Being mentored by then Dean Judy Raper also had a positive impact on Alana. \u201cI was very fortunate to do my thesis under the tutelage of Judy Raper, who was a great female role model. She helped me early on in my career by giving me guidance around how to apply my technical skills to real world problems.\u201d. She hopes her own experience will drive other young women to consider studying engineering. \u201cI\u2019d love to help women choose this career path in any way,\u201d she says. \u201cEngineering can lead you anywhere you want to go in life and is a core foundation skill for the future of work.\u201d. Even now, years after leaving the University, Alana credits her chemical engineering degree with giving her the knowledge that built a successful career in STEM and business. \u201cAs a person it gave me the confidence to know I can achieve whatever I set out to do. Everything I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to do stemmed from my time doing chemical engineering at Sydney.\u201d."

            "Professor Athman Bouguettaya, Head of the School of Computer Science, has been awarded the Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE) Fellow Award in recognition for his ongoing research in the field of service computing. It is the latest honour for Professor Bouguettaya, who was previously named the TSCVC Research Innovation Award recipient for outstanding innovations in the field of service computing by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The accolade bestowed by the WISE Society celebrates Professor Bouguettaya\u2019s pioneering research into advancing and progressing service computing, cloud computing, databases and web information systems \u2013 particularly in the growing area of the Internet of Things (IoT). \u201cI am honoured to have been recognised by my peers and presented with such a prestigious award, especially as there are only a handful of recipients globally,\u201d says Professor Bouguettaya, who has published over more than 240 books, chapters and journal articles in his research field. \u201cIt is testament to the hard work conducted not only by myself in the areas of service computing and more recently the Internet of Things, but also my outstanding research group and research collaborators.\u201d. Professor Bouguettaya\u2019s current research focuses on leveraging the IoT to transform data generated by sensors and information technology devices into useful and ready-to-use information, called service. This abstraction enables the delivery of advanced digital technologies to end users. An example of this is the use of energy-as-service, generated by smart clothes and shared via WiFi. In this instance, the transfer of energy bypasses the use of the energy grid and provides an alternative for green and renewable energy to charge devices within WiFi reach. The WISE Society functions as a collective of international researchers, professionals and industrial practitioners that promotes the advancement of web information systems academia, including big data techniques and applications, blockchain technologies, cloud computing, machine learning for the web and cybersecurity."

            "School of Chemistry researchers are partnering with Rux Energy Pty Limited and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) to develop new molecular materials capable of the highly efficient storage of hydrogen gas. \u201cA critical challenge in the realisation of hydrogen-based energy cycles is the ability to store hydrogen gas safely and efficiently,\u201d said Professor Cameron Kepert. \u201cFor many applications, this requires looking beyond the use of ultra-high pressures or ultra-low temperatures, towards chemical solutions that operate under non-extreme conditions. \u201cOur partnership with Rux Energy and ANSTO is developing new porous materials capable of storing large amounts of hydrogen per mass and volume, with the goal being to generate a library of materials that target individual hydrogen applications, spanning the smaller scale areas such as hydrogen vehicles all the way through to large-scale stationary storage and transport.\u201d. According to fellow group member Dr Lauren Macreadie, Australia is in a prime position to be at the forefront of global hydrogen storage and delivery due to its abundance of natural resources. \u201cTo make this an efficient and economical process, we need to have the means to implement safe hydrogen energy storage and delivery technologies, which is extremely important for future energy use and a global initiative,\u201d said Dr Macreadie. \u201cThis new technology we are collaborating on with our partners can address the current hydrogen storage challenges and pave a way for Australian hydrogen industries on a breadth of scale.\u201d."

            "The unit, titled Sustainable Design, Engineering and Management ENGG5202, gave students an insight into environmental and sustainability challenges facing Australia and the world, and how engineering addresses these challenges. More than 300 students participated in the course, with majors including electrical, chemical, telecommunications, and civil. Working in teams with elected Project Managers and Team Leaders, students were tasked with the design of a sustainable city. Students worked through a different sustainability topic each week before presenting their designs in the final week. With group work a critical component of the course and approximately 75 per cent of students working remotely, course coordinator Professor PJ Cullen and course manager Dr Behdad Soltani had the challenge of engaging students and building a sense of community across teams.",
            "Each tutorial started with an overall discussion on Zoom, before breaking into subgroups for students to progress groupwork. Tutors dropped in and out of the subgroups, and students used additional tools such as the Canvas blackboard feature and WeChat. On the surface, this model aligns with what students worldwide have become used to over the last year. However, several measures ensured high levels of student participation and collaboration. Tutors recorded videos for students to watch before each tutorial, expanding on what was covered in the lectures and what to expect in the upcoming tutorial. This meant all students were prepared and ready to engage in discussion.",
            "All students were asked to switch their cameras on to build relationships and increase engagement. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that every single student receives support and that no one gets missed\u201d, said Course Manager Dr Behdad Soltani. \u201cGenerally in a big class you can end up not knowing who else is in the class, especially over Zoom. We had a face-to-face connection with everyone \u2013 students were asked to turn their cameras on, and we knew them and they knew us.\u201d.",
            "Careful consideration went into the group allocations, ensuring that a diverse range of disciplines and backgrounds were represented and that at least one student in each group was studying on campus. Though studying remotely, Project Manager of the green team David (Yunxiang) Deng successfully managed a group of 50 by working closely with the other Project Manager in the team, Xinyang (Yang) Pei, who was based on campus. \"Yang and I based our leadership approach on three key characteristics\u201d, said Deng. \u201cWe maintained frequent communication with multiple calls each week, we empathised with each other and with the students, and we utilised our different personalities to get the most out of the group\u201d.",
            "The assessment structure also allowed students to gain skills outside of the sustainability topics, with a focus on groupwork and communication. Yellow team Project Manager Nikolaos Varnas described it as a unique course and enjoyed the opportunity to take on a leadership role. \u201cThis course had a completely different structure from all other courses I have studied at university, and gave us a real perspective of how large firms' hierarchy works\u201d, said Varnas.",
            "Ruizhe Zhao, Project Manager of the white team, also found the support provided by tutor Chiara Fois enabled him to make the most out of the course and gain skills and knowledge that exceeded the course content. \u201cOur tutor provided valuable advice to not only understand the content of study, but also in team management to support the groups \u2013 we have continued mentorship since the course finished.\u201d.",
            "The final presentations delivered at the end of the course demonstrated the wide range of experience and knowledge the students had brought to the course, presenting the students\u2019 visions of practical cities designed to face some of the world\u2019s pressing environmental challenges.",
            "Course coordinator Professor PJ Cullen said the final presentations were a result of significant planning and organisation. \u201cOrganisation was a critical component of getting this course to work, both for us and the students. The 2021 cohort met this challenge with some inspiring proposals that included working with the city\u2019s natural landscape and initiatives such as diverting unsorted waste into gasification plants.\u201d."

Projects across critical industries such as infrastructure, construction, and resources can now have major impacts on wider industry dynamics, the regulatory landscape, and the environment \u2013 to name a few. Most major projects operate in an unstructured environment and are becoming more complex in terms of technology, evolving project scope, organisational changes, and the interrelationships between stakeholders and government. According to Michael Curtin, Director for Executive Leadership in Major Projects (ELMP) program, leaders need to adapt their skills to prepare for future project management to operate fundamentally differently.",
            "\u201cWhile some aspects of leadership, such as setting a vision, executing on strategy, and applying methodologies to manage and deliver complex projects will remain, the future leader will need to possess a new arsenal of skills. \"For instance, to lead effectively they need the ability to manage \u2018grey spaces\u2019 within projects and their stakeholders.\u201d.",

Adapting leadership practice ensures projects can be managed in this new, unstable environment. \u201cModern leaders use evidence-based, contemporary methods, theories and research to understand human behaviour. They develop models and mindsets to increase their leadership reach and support project outcomes.\u201d. With traditional project management approaches no longer fit for dealing with complex projects, project leaders must apply their experience, knowledge and skills to adapt new and innovative techniques.",
            "The increasingly complex nature of projects requires acknowledgement and incorporation of the project\u2019s human, contextual, and emergent elements. This includes understanding the group dynamics in high-performing teams, which enables leaders to develop strategies and tactics to increase their team\u2019s capability and engagement. \u201cThe most effective leadership strategies drive organisational change and prepare for the future while maintaining team performance\u201d.",
            "In project management, a transformational shift from an information age of interrelated systems to a knowledge area is highlighting a focus on interconnected capabilities. Multidisciplinary knowledge and skills are critical to managing internal and external stakeholders. Leveraging established capabilities is a valuable tool to engage with a diverse set of stakeholders. Building the necessary capabilities, behaviours, and mindsets ensures the project ecosystem is engaged and motivated to achieve success.",
            "Finally, strong leaders expand their strategic view to account for the environment they operate in. In a complex landscape, embracing and enabling for innovation, commitment and accountability sets a project up for success despite a fast-changing environment.",
            "\u201cWe can no longer assume that projects can be fully controlled. Adapting to these uncertainties allows project leaders to adjust their strategies accordingly. \"They must find ways to understand projects as a bigger dynamic system of value and meaning for now and the future\u201d.",

            "Held in April, the workshop gave participants the opportunity to hear from research students, industry engineers, and academics on their experiences working in computer science research. The Google exploreCSR awards aim to aid university efforts to support students from underrepresented groups to pursue graduate studies and research careers in computing. When applying for funding, the university had to submit a program running plan and sustainment plan to demonstrate the ongoing benefits to students. Other considerations included the diversity of partnering organisations who would support the program, how well the university understood the needs of the students, and the proposed workshop content. Dr Caren Han, Associate Lecturer in Programming and Software Development, attributes the successful application to their sustainment plan and the experience of the academics involved. \u201cThe sustainment plan was an important factor, as it demonstrates we\u2019re committed to the students beyond just the workshop\u201d, she said. \u201cThe academic team members have wide-ranging experience in running outreach programs, which also strengthened the application.\u201d. The exploreCSR award aligns with the university\u2019s longstanding efforts to support women in studying engineering and computer science, which include high school outreach programs, scholarships, and student societies.",
            "Over two days a combination of presentations, panel discussions and research workshops exposed participants to computing research methodologies and possible career pathways. Researchers shared their own projects and introduced participants opportunities across academia, research organisations, industry and start-ups. In groups, participants were assigned a research problem and a Research Leader who worked with them to develop the research project in response. Topics spanned key areas of human computer interaction, computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing and data science. Following the workshops students regularly met with their Research Leaders to seek input and ensure their research projects progressed before the presentation night held later in April. The sessions allowed participants to identify their objectives, define the most appropriate methodology, implement the project, and evaluate the outcomes. At the presentation night they could reflect on their learnings and share these with peers, researchers and faculty staff.",

However, I enjoyed maths, and assumed that computer science would involve a lot of maths. \u201cNow I\u2019m motivated by more advanced and high-tech work such as AI programming, and using my knowledge to make a tangible contribution.\u201d. Attending the workshop also highlighted the potential advantages of pursuing a research career. \u201cAfter hearing the guest speakers\u2019 experiences, I was struck by the flexibility that research allows you. If you are interested in something \u2013 you can do it! It\u2019s an opportunity to focus on your own curiosity while being responsible for that project.\u201d.",

My designs are conscious of the properties of new storage hardware and thus lead to large performance improvements in terms of throughput and tail latency. This work is practical and can be applied right away to data-centre storage systems. In fact, part of my work is already deployed in industry at Nutanix, a cloud computing company that I have been collaborating with throughout my PhD.",

            "A collaboration between the Faculty of Engineering and the University of Sydney Business School in a new multidisciplinary learning format named the Idea Factory is providing students with advanced communication and intercultural skills that reflect the workplaces they will move into, improving their employability. The format, which has seen over 300 participants since the first implementation in 2019, is a cooperative project between students of ELEC5518: IoT for Critical Infrastructures and MKTG6004: New Product Development. The Idea Factory enables students from these two units to work together in groups and develop a commercial product from beginning to end \u2013 including market research, a business plan, prototype testing, and more. As part of the assessment, groups pitch their product innovation to a panel of teaching staff and experts across industries. The Idea Factory has been shortlisted for the 2020 QS-Wharton Reimagine Education Awards, the world\u2019s largest honour program for innovative pedagogies, in the category of Nurturing Employability. The academic behind the program, Dr Mahyar Shirvanimoghaddam ( School of Electrical and Information Engineering ), designed it to improve student engagement through collaboration with students from other disciplines, gaining work-related skills/experience and promoting entrepreneurialism. The program helps engineering students grow their understanding of product commercialisation and compliment the real-world hands-on experiences they receive as a part of their degree. \u201cOur students are really smart and welcome new approaches to learning. We need to continue to develop strategies to fully unleash their potentials,\u201d says Dr Shirvanimoghaddam. Unit of Study surveys for ELEC5518 have shown high satisfaction levels, particularly in the development of interpersonal, communication and entrepreneurial skills.",
            "ICane group project. ICane: a virtual cane for the vision-impaired. Jichao Leng was a Master of Engineering (Telecommunications Engineering) student when he enrolled in ELEC5518. He is now a PhD candidate in the Centre for IoT and Telecommunications within the School of Electrical and Information Engineering. His group developed ICane, an innovative smart device that assists the vision-impaired and their families with mobility and day-to-day activities. The ICane provides independence to the vision-impaired through obstacle detection up to 5 metres. It also provides confidence to family members of the ICane users, with features such as an LTE and Wi-Fi network connection through the cloud, real-time GPS position, and abnormal state alarm so that loved ones may be alerted if the user requires assistance.",
            "\u201cAs an engineering student, I realised that I think about problems only from the technical level. However, in the real world, people don\u2019t pay for technology directly. It is important to transform technology into products that are meaningful to the market. The marketing students have this kind of knowledge, and we learned a lot from them,\u201d Jichao said. Jichao believes that the Idea Factory was an important exercise which has enhanced his skills in other projects and prompted him to diversify his study. \u201cCompared to simply doing research, participating in practical application projects and collaborating with different people means I can learn more. I am currently completing a project at Westmead Children\u2019s Hospital, \u2018the COVID-2019 eGate health screening system\u2019, as an IoT engineer. I\u2019ve learned it is not enough to only consider technology,\u201d he said. Stella Qiu was a Master of Commerce student specialising in marketing when she enrolled in MKTG6004, also in the group that developed ICane. Since then, she has worked in a number of marketing roles and is currently a Junior Marketing Manager in the education sector. Similar to Jichao, Stella noticed how important the collaborative aspect was to fostering high-quality project outcomes. \u201cWhen I do a project with business students, we focus on whether the idea was creative or attractive \u2013 in this project, the engineering students provided many practical and technical suggestions. It was similar to a real working environment,\" said Stella. Written by Nicole Baxter."

The National STEM School Education Strategy agreed by Australia\u2019s state education ministers in December 2016 specifies: Goal 1: Ensure all students finish school with a strong foundational knowledge in STEM and related skills. Goal 2: Ensure that students are inspired to take on more challenging STEM subjects. The introduction of digital literacy curriculum into primary schools reflect the changing requirements for success in today\u2019s digital world, but resources for teachers are not evolving as quickly. Primary school teachers have always been \u201cjacks-of-all-trades\u201d as contrasted to their more specialised secondary teacher counterparts. The AustSTEM Foundation created the Kookaberry to tackle some of the challenges primary teachers face and to help them teach the new Technologies curriculum with confidence. The Kookaberry is designed to make things easier for teachers and to ensure digital technology can be integrated into all subjects.",

The Kookaberry uses a wide selection of plug-and-play sensors, indicators and control elements. Simple menus navigate pre-programmed on-board applications. Independent of Wi-Fi and the internet, the unit is fully self-contained. The device engages both students and educators directly with science, technology, and mathematics. The Kookaberry is a tool to bring real-world data and experiences into project-based learning throughout the primary curriculum. Its open-source technology is compatible with Arduino and the Micro: bit."

It can be a digital thermometer, motion detector, clock, music generator, and can run classic games such as space invaders or pong. One of the most powerful features is its MicroPython on-board code editor, which allows teachers and students to modify the Kookaberry\u2019s capabilities directly. The current target price is under $30 for a large quantity manufacturing run of this Australian designed device in Australia."

            "The circular economy refers to a system where resources are redeployed and reused and waste flows are turned into inputs for further production. These processes can happen at any scale from the composting of organic waste for gardening to entire industrial systems which exchange waste streams \u2013 moving away from our current linear economy model, in which 80-90% of goods become waste within six months of consumption. Moving to the circular economy model will reduce waste and could also mean huge cost savings. But its creation and enactment will involve reform at a system level, product level and consumer level. The circular economy requires a large overhaul of industrial systems to fully enable a closed resource loop and ensure full resource productivity. To date, The Warren Centre has released it's own reports on the Circular Economy (PDF, 4.6MB) that addresses the global trends and future challenges."

            "The delivery of major infrastructure and buildings requires detailed planning, design and construction. Robust but efficient approval procedures are vital to ensure safety. The process necessitates that all parties involved in the development understand and are appropriately qualified to deliver. This is particularly true for fire safety engineering. The risks associated with failed fire safety were made clear by London's Grenfell fire tragedy in 2017, which caused the deaths of 71 residents and injured a further seventy. The Grenfell tragedy was believed to be exacerbated by combustible external cladding that enabled the fire to ascend rapidly unimpeded, despite the efforts of fire crews. This event triggered a public inquiry in the United Kingdom and multiple parallel reviews around the world, including here in Australia. While many inquiries are focused on products and appropriate cladding, we recognise that there is a much bigger issue to be considered that speaks to the core of fire safety engineering. To date, The Warren Centre has released nine specific reports on this topic. They are: the Regulation, Control and Accreditation Report (PDF, 4.7MB), examining the current requirements or controls over practitioners employed or engaged in the building industry in the practice of fire safety engineering;, the Education Report (PDF, 4.6MB), discussing the current status of education and training of fire safety engineers; as well as the competencies which are expected of a fire safety engineering professional;, the Methods Report (PDF, 3.9MB), which takes a closer look at international guidelines and methods currently used and considers where fundamental change is needed for Australia;, the Roles Report (PDF, 8.1MB), exploring the future role, competencies, education, accreditation, audit and enforcement and regulatory controls for fire safety engineering in Australia;, the Competencies Report (PDF, 2.4MB), which points towards an accreditation framework for professional engineers in fire safety;, the Professional Development Report (PDF, 9.7MB), addresses the resource and skill constraints hindering the full professionalisation of fire safety engineering, in order to one day achieve a sustainable provision of fire safety engineering professionals;, the Accreditation and Regulatory Reform Report (PDF, 11MB), sets a plan for how Australia should assess and accredit engineers who seek to practice fire safety design and take responsibility for public safety in their work;, the Final Report (PDF, 13.3MB), develops a pragmatic plan on a transition from the current state of fire safety engineering and design in Australia, which differs across states and territories in relation to regulation, registration, and other practice controls, to the required regulatory, education, accreditation and registration state which will ensure a full and proper profession for fire safey engineers; and, the Comparison of FSE Guidance Documents and Assessment Criteria Report (2.1MB), provides a review of four guidance documents for fire safety engineering to determine their suitability for use in Australia. As well as the 1989 Fire Safety and Engineering Project Report, Fire Safety and Engineering - International Symposium Papers and Fire Safety and Engineering: Technical Papers Book 1."

Internet of Things. We can provide the whole solutions for IoT system design and large-scale deployment for various applications, including remote monitoring, tracking, identifications, control, automation, microgrids and asset management. The Centre for IoT and Telecommunications is currently working in collaboration with the Tyree Foundation to explore wireless networked control and management of active distribution networks. The motivation for the project came from the global transformation of power systems driven by the increasing uptake of variable renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar and wind, and the need to develop new methodologies and tools for power system operation. The project will develop an active distribution network testbed and provide the underpinning science in the area of energy management and control over wireless networks. The testbed will be based on a combination of a real-time digital simulator and a number of physical devices in a hardware in the loop configuration, connected to a software defined wireless virtual network.

For example, we have worked in collaboration with Sustainable House to develop a solar-powered automated watering system for an EcoPOP planter. The brief involved the creation of a robust and reliable automated water pumping system that would run on solar power and could be programed to provide irrigation to the plant bed. Our solution provided sufficient energy storage to allow for many days of low solar radiation, with low standby power consumption. An Arduino microcontroller was used to manage the pump, solenoid operation and energy supply."

            "The delivery of major infrastructure and buildings requires detailed planning, design and construction. Robust but efficient approval procedures are vital to ensure safety. The process necessitates that all parties involved in the development understand and are appropriately qualified to deliver. This is particularly true for fire safety engineering. The risks associated with failed fire safety were made clear by London's Grenfell fire tragedy in 2017, which caused the deaths of 71 residents and injured a further seventy. The Grenfell tragedy was believed to be exacerbated by combustible external cladding that enabled the fire to ascend rapidly unimpeded, despite the efforts of fire crews. This event triggered a public inquiry in the United Kingdom and multiple parallel reviews around the world, including here in Australia. While many inquiries are focused on products and appropriate cladding, we recognise that there is a much bigger issue to be considered that speaks to the core of fire safety engineering. To date, The Warren Centre has released three specific reports on this topic. They are: the Education Report (PDF, 4.6MB), dicussing the current status of education and training of fire safety engineers; as well as the competencies which are expected of a fire safety engineering professional;, the Regulation, Control and Accreditation Report (PDF, 4.7MB), examining the current requirements or controls over practicioners employed or engaged in the building industry in the practice of fire safety engineering; and, the Methods Report (PDF, 3.9MB), which takes a closer look at international guidelines and methods currently used and considers where fundamental change is needed for Australia. Each is surmised in our overall interim report that examines the overall Role of Fire Safety Engineering (PDF, 500KB)."

These processes can happen at any scale from the composting of organic waste for gardening to entire industrial systems which exchange waste streams \u2013 moving away from our current linear economy model, in which 80-90% of goods become waste within six months of consumption. Moving to the circular economy model will reduce waste and could also mean huge cost savings. But its creation and enactment will involve reform at a system level, product level and consumer level. The circular economy requires a large overhaul of industrial systems to fully enable a closed resource loop and ensure full resource productivity. To date, The Warren Centre has released it's own reports on the Circular Economy (PDF, 4.6MB) that addresses the global trends and future challenges."

The laboratory is currently under redevelopment to use some of the ABB equipment as part of an active distribution network testbed in collaboration with the Centre of Excellence in Telecommunications. Who was Sir William Tyree?. Sir William Tyree (1921\u20132013) was a pioneering electrical engineer and generous philanthropist, committed to innovation and leading-edge technological advancement. His awards and honours are as numerous as they are impressive. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1971, and a few years later was made a Knight Bachelor in honour of his services to the community. In 2001 Sir William received the Centenary Medal in recognition of his service to Australian society in electrical engineering and manufacturing. The University also awarded Sir William a Higher Doctorate in Engineering (honoris causa) in 2008. In the 1990s the AW Tyree Foundation, which Sir William established, sponsored the Tyree Scholarship for Information Technologies for undergraduate students. In 2009 a substantial gift from Sir William was used towards the redevelopment of the Power Engineering Laboratory, which was subsequently named in his honour."

            "Wave Flume. Our Wave Flume, measured at 30 metres long by one metre wide and one metre deep, is made from high-quality glass panels with a beach installed at one end to minimise wave reflection. It is equipped with the Edinburgh Designs piston-type wave generator which allows generation of regular and irregular waves. The wave generator measures the reflective wave and corrects the paddle motion to absorb it. The resultant wave field is totally predictable even with highly reflective models. Irregular wave fields can be generated by empirical functions built into the Edinburgh Designs OCEAN software (including Pierson Moskowitz, Bretschneider and Jonswap spectra) or user defined power spectral densities. Spectral peak frequencies generated range between 0.40\u20132.0Hz, equivalent to full-scale wave periods of 5\u201320s. Wave height and water level measurements are made using resistance or capacitance wave probes, available in a range of lengths from 200mm to 1000mm."

Analysis of this data by scientists has shown a strong correlation between the complexity of the terrain, hydrothermal venting and biological community distribution. We have also examined how imaging data collected at multiple resolutions can facilitate surveys across large areas of seafloor, while allowing us to examine the taxonomic resolution at which species can be identified.

The dynamic nature of tidal fluxes within estuaries is important due to the effect it has on mixing salinity, oxygen and nutrients between fresh water and salt water. The shallow nature of some parts of estuaries lends themselves to a small platform that can sample, model and plan without disturbing the environment. By estimating models online, an autonomous moving platform can optimise sampling strategies to collect the most informative data. Troy has demonstrated how a small ASV with online planning capability can generate a map of a previously unknown seafloor contour. He is developing methods to allow such a vessel to model salinity levels around a moving tidal front."

We're developing the algorithms and techniques to design and evaluate safety metrics that can assure safety in a particular operation design domain (ODD). The project will look at characterising uncertainty in perception and control to be used with safety metrics to evaluate the level of safety and perform risk assessment of connected and automated vehicles in well-defined domains."

It questions to what extent people evaluate the robot motion as \u2018collaborative\u2019 on \u2018non-collaborative\u2019 during accomplishing a task with a robot. By referring to sociological perspective, our approach is to consider that the people\u2019s perception of robot motion is a social construction.

Optical signal processing is expected to effectively handle high-speed, broadband signals in advanced optical communications systems and information processing. This can provide direct interfacing of fibre processing with high-speed systems. Photonic signal processors can overcome limitations imposed by conventional electrical signal processors at sampling speeds above 1GHz. In addition photonic processors are compatible with fibre-optic transmission systems and can process signals in the optical domain directly. Research is aimed at deriving new structures that can perform high speed processing tasks on the signals that are contained within the fibre. Applications both in the frequency domain and time domain include microwave filtering, interference suppressors, channel selectors, fast signal correlation, matched filtering and programmable delay lines."

This exploits the wavelength selectivity of gratings to realise a highly parallel delay processing function, which perform the complex signal delay processing equalisation on a large number of array elements simultaneously within the fibre. Our new architecture uses wavelength mapping to the array elements and partitioning concepts.

In this project, we will develop a new approach to control of nonlinear systems based on contraction theory and convex optimisation, extending the power of optimisation-based control from linear to non-linear systems.

With today's exponential growth of wireless technologies and the rapid movement towards IoT, the need for a reliable energy supply is more tangible than ever. Energy harvesting is one potentially sustainable solution for prolonging the lifetime of wireless networks, particularly harvesting energy from radio frequency (RF) signals. The integration of RF energy transfer with wireless communication networks has led to the emergence of the research area known as wireless powered communication network (WPCN). In this network, users are powered by a hybrid access point (HAP) which transfers wireless energy to the users in addition to serving the functionalities of a conventional access point. Our research has extended the baseline model of WPCN to a dual-hop WPCN (DH-WPCN) in which a number of energy-limited relays are in charge of assisting the information exchange between energy-stable users and the HAP. We studied uplink and downlink information transmission in the DH-WPCN and designed algorithms for optimising the performance of the network in both directions. We also tackled the doubly near-far problem \u2013 which occurs due to unequal distance of the relays from the HAP \u2013 by proposing a fairness enhancement mechanism that guarantees throughput fairness among all users."

Advanced vehicular networking technology is increasingly playing an important role in the design of wireless connected vehicles.

Consequently, the ultimate challenge of the network designer is the wireless propagation characteristics for both vehicle-to-vehicle (VTV) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (VTI) communications. Our previous work on the best path selection on multi-hop vehicular communication uses the assumption of narrow-band system design resulting from stationary or quasi-static channels. In this work, we extend the cluster-based MIMO multi-hop best relaying into vehicular communication in time-varying channel for both VTV and VTI links. We deploy an optimal precoder and receiver filter design to mitigate interference from secondary cluster transmission at local and global power constraint, with perfect channel state information (CSI) in all links. We develop a mathematical model to find the optimal best path to enhance the network quality of services (QoS) for further studies and analysis. Computer simulation will be conducted to verify the correctness and accuracy of the theoretical derivatives."

Testing demonstrated that the cooperative communication range for a moving relay depends upon its transmission power and the direction of travel.

Worldwide mobile data usage has grown approximately 70 percent annually in recent years, requiring the mobile industry to provide high-performance mobile service to end users and create next-generation mobile technologies. Long-term evolution (LTE), as a popular cellular technology, has grown in importance due to its high data rate and better data access technique for mobile devices. However, LTE still may still be limited due to the existing spectrum insufficiency in licensed bands. To sustain the possible growth in mobile capacity demand, the unlicensed band is being considered as a supplementary band for LTE and a favourable solution to increase the capacity of mobile systems. Based on the improvement of carrier aggregation, 3GPP has approved a study item that will support LTE by offloading mobile data in the unlicensed band. Hence, LTE will run on the spectrum that overlaps with wi-fi, which is another common unlicensed band technology. The concern is that LTE and wi-fi are unlikely to have mechanisms that directly coordinate with each other, considering dissimilar core networks, backhauls and deployment plans of LTE and wi-fi networks. The goals of this project are to explore how LTE will influence wi-fi when both of them share the same channel and to develop a possible coexistence procedure to initiate the coexistence between LTE and wi-fi in the unlicensed band."

The increased interest in the use of traffic-intensive applications like high definition (HD) video, augmented reality, wearable devices and 3D visualisation is expected to result in a higher growth in network traffic. Video traffic \u2013 and particularly popular titles \u2013 account for a major proportion of this traffic, shifting the interest of researchers towards cooperative content caching in mobile networks and its services in terms of efficient cache placement. In such a caching scheme, both the mobile terminals and base stations cache content with cooperation, which overcomes the problem of redundant caching by getting rid of multiple and unnecessary copies of the same files in the network nodes. In a cache-enabled D2D-underlaid cellular network, we aim to formulate cooperation-based caching that will further exploit the limited storage capacity and result in a more efficient wireless resource utilisation. Independent cache resources owned by mobile terminals can be jointly optimised with specific target files for a defined regime. This can be done by heterogeneously assigning correlated file groups to different clusters using stochastic geometry and optimisation theory methods. The spatial and temporal variation of data popularity provides significant information for designing an optimised model in this regard. Our performance goal for such a model includes achieving a higher hit probability and throughput gain during peak hours, achieving a near optimal delay performance during localised D2D transmissions, and studying the effect of varying co-op devices in a given cluster."

Our collaborators: Dr Kumudu Munasinghe (University of Canberra), Dr Md Farhad Hossain (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology). Conventional conservative planning and optimisation of cellular mobile networks for supporting the peak-time user demand leads to substantial wastage of electrical energy. Infrastructure sharing among geographically collocated networks is considered promising for energy-efficient operation of future cellular systems. In this project we are developing a generalised energy-efficient cooperation framework for sharing base stations among the cellular radio-access networks (RANs) serving the same geographical area. The cooperating base stations belonging to different RANs do not need to be collocated. Independent Poisson point process is used for modelling the near realistic random locations of both base systems and user equipment. Under the proposed framework, base stations belonging to different RANs dynamically share each other\u2019s traffic and thus allow some base stations to switch into low power sleep mode for saving energy. During this base station switching through traffic sharing, connection continuity (no drop of the existing calls) is maintained throughout the network. A generalised optimisation problem for maximising energy savings is formulated. Due to the high complexity of the optimisation problem, heuristically guided algorithms differing in BS selection and UE association policies are proposed. More specifically, two different BSs selection schemes and three separate UE association policies are integrated in the algorithms. Performance of the proposed inter-RAN cooperation framework is evaluated using extensive simulations demonstrating a substantial energy savings and gain in energy efficiency. Impact of different network parameters, such as BS selection and UE association policies, BS and UE densities, BS power profile and SINR requirements for connection continuity on the system performance is thoroughly investigated and analysed."

This research project aims to develop novel PLS methods for wireless powered communication networks based on exploiting the coordination of cooperative jamming transmission and wireless power transfer.

Seventy-five percent of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered in water, yet a large proportion is unexplored. This is especially the case for deep oceanic waters, where it is extremely difficult and expensive for humans to explore. Being low cost, robust and relatively simply to deploy, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been touted as a potential solution to providing access to such uncharted waters. Wireless sensor networks have capabilities defined by their individual nodes or sensors. In most cases, the sensors have low battery life (with the exception of power harvesting capabilities) and low memory and processing abilities. Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) apply further constraints to an already constrained network and have limitations dependent on the communications technology used. For radio frequency communications, the signal is highly attenuated. For acoustic communications, signals are inhibited by high propagation delay and low bandwidth. This introduces high latency into the network, which for localisation and other applications would require each sensor to have a precise clock and is cost prohibitive. Acoustic networks also require higher transmission power, which detracts from our power consumption constraint. Compounding issues further, lack of access to the global positioning system and the effect of passive node mobility created by underwater currents makes localisation and network organisation difficult. Our research is based on the self-organisation of UWSN nodes into clusters determined by their mobility patterns. Neighbouring nodes with similar mobility patterns are clustered together, which ensures their spatial correlation over time. By doing so, we reduce the number of lost packets, which satisfies our battery constraint criteria and leads to improved network lifetimes."

With the increasing demands in different applications and scenarios of information explosion, it requires a need for a framework for efficient communication among the vehicles in the network termed as vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V). Addressing such a communication in these networks has become a research challenge due its unique characteristics. This work aims to develop a distributed and cooperative framework for efficient communication in such a highly-dynamic network. The framework applies cross-layer architecture by integrating the advantages of the application and network layers. It uses a publish/subscribe paradigm at the application layer, with content-based routing, and applies a multicast routing protocol at the network layer to perform network communication. To enable successful communication it is important for the vehicles to cooperate with each other so that the information communicated over the network reaches the destined vehicles. Security and privacy also play a vital role accounting for the integrity and confidentiality of the information communicated. This is addressed by using cooperation techniques that apply game-theoretic models. The 'public goods game' from economics is applied to model group interactions in vehicular networks and analyses the extent of cooperation of the vehicles under different network conditions."

It is also challenging for an edge fusion centre running computing tasks over large data sets with a limited computation capacity to interpret the meaning behind the collected data. To tackle these challenges, by exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channel and the functional decomposition,the recently proposed technique, over-the-air computation (AirComp), enables an effective joint data collection and computation from concurrent sensor transmissions. Our project aims to develop new AirComp systems and novel algorithms for high-efficiency pervasive wireless data fusion."

As autonomous vehicles (AVs) emerge as the dominant technology in road transport, the system is expected to change supporting improvements in road efficiency and safety. Traditional lane-changing models simulate how drivers make decisions, and sometimes these algorithms do not reflect real-world conditions. Our project develops an evolutionary game theory based lane-changing model to describe the competition of multiple vehicles during a lane-change manoeuvre. The model is suitable to describe human-driven and AV traffic, and can be deployed in future AVs to produce safer, more efficient lane changes."

Transit networks are born, grow, mature, and decline over time resulting in the current unique state of network structure and land use. This research aims to characterise railway network evolution over a long period of time and to evaluate its projected impacts on land use development by simulating the co-evolution of railways (trains and trams) and urban development (terraces and towers) in urban Sydney. Differing from previous studies, the integrated development of transit networks and urban space is investigated using historical data. This simulation allows us to analyse the emergent functional hierarchy of the railway network and agglomeration patterns of land use and to explore network-land use interactions such as reinforcement or contraction."

This research is aimed at understanding the nature of the causal relationship between network investments and travel demand using time-series analyses and Granger causality tests. While such analyses have been made in the context of land-use and transport networks, this research extends the approach to travel demand, particularly mode choice, and thereby offers practical results for transport planners and decision makers."

Increased data availability makes it possible to measure and value the importance of rare events (extreme delay caused by crashes, natural disasters or special events) in traveller decisions about mode, route or departure time. This project used a stated-preference experiment to explore the trade-off between the magnitude and frequency of long delays resulting in better estimates of the value of reliability."

Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) provides network-wide signal timings to minimise delay to road traffic, which can lead to negative outcomes for pedestrians and cyclists. Simulations (Mayhook 2017) suggest that including pedestrian delay leads to a different set of signal timings that is more inclusive. This project seeks to quantify the inequity and inefficiency of the status quo with observations of the number of delayed pedestrians, the amount of delay they incur and queue spillback. The outcome is empirical evidence to support a more equitable algorithm for green time."

To improve traffic operation efficiency in large-scale urban networks, control policies must think more holistically about network behaviour. A recent approach to extend the spatial extent of traffic signal control to the network level is perimeter flow control based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model. This project advances that work in three directions: Perimeter Flow Control with Time-varying Cordon based on MFD, Day-to-day Dynamics in Perimeter Flow Control Scheme based on MFD, and Subregional Time-dependent Congestion Pricing Strategy of Large-scale Networks. The project outcome is flexible and effective control strategies to cope with large, uncertain, irregular traffic networks."

The access contention causes collision, forcing them to retransmit the same packet multiple times and to continuously sense the channel to determine the suitable time for retransmission. As a consequence, each device will have high energy consumption and transmission latency, which is detrimental for many industrial IoT devices. The objective of this project is to design an algorithm to resolve contention (contention resolution) in a way that improves energy efficiency and latency of the industrial IoT network."

However, in 2004 QI was theoretically proven and successfully implemented via classical thermal lights, breaking the requirement of entanglement and extending QI into classical optical areas. Since the reinvention in 2010 the reconstruction methods of QI have been further expanded, as have its applications and scenarios. Our research of QI mainly focuses on the fundamental design of QI and its implementation by using microwave and mm-wave signals. For the former, our interest lies in the mathematical basis of QI while for the latter we are concentrating on the design of microwave/mm-wave QI system structures."

Wireless operators are facing an unprecedented increase in a new cellular traffic demand, predicted to expand 1000 times by 2020. These new demands could lead to a spectrum outage, motivating multiple network operators to share their current spectrum with each other in each base station (BS), equipped with multiple antennas. In this case the network operators will function as virtual operators (VOs), operating in the same spectrum within a single BS. As a consequence, there is the risk of interference in uplink transmissions by users from different VOs. Our hypothesis is that steering the receive beamforming in vertical and horizontal directions for each VO in the BS in different directions in a way they are not interfering with each other can effectively cancel this interference. In this case, spectrum efficiency can be increased for all VOs and the quality of service for each user from VOs can be guaranteed as well."

We led the pioneering development of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach under Emeritus Professor Graeme Bird. Our research reveals that fundamental challenges exist in computational fluid flow in aerospace applications, associated with the typical high-speed and large-scale objects. This leads to highly turbulent flow fields with thin, yet incredibly important, boundary layers. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research focuses on three key core competencies: improved CFD algorithms; improved understanding of the underlying physics; and improved computational models of complex problems. These are crucial for the global aerospace industry. Highlights in these competencies include the development of new fully compressible methods, able to resolve turbulent fluctuations at low Mach. These methods permit accurate computations of flows, involving both high and low-speed components, such as flow separations, recirculation and flows in wheel bays or weapons bays. In collaboration with our partners, we are working on advanced models of rotor blades to assist helicopters in approaching the flight deck of Royal Australian Navy vessels. These models are an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches and aim to enable accurate assessments of the safety of approaches under different weather and operational conditions. Our low Mach fully-compressible solvers enable us to address challenges in aeroacoustics, through ongoing research collaboration with Jaguar Land Rover. We have developed novel RANS-LES approaches that permit the computation of automotive aeroacoustics at a practical Reynolds number.

We're developing an integrated satellite power and data bus, in which the power and data share the same electric wire. Put another way, this will be Power over Ethernet (PoE) on a satellite rather than just in office buildings and homes; that is, the power transmission line will interconnect satellite subsystems and payloads for data communication. This Power Data Bus will involve two major parts, power distribution (via a smart battery array) and data transmission (signal injection and extraction from the power line). The smart battery array will improve the compatibility of satellite electrical power systems. Each smart battery will have a microcontroller to control its usage and health, which will maximise battery efficiency and life, and also reduce the workload of the satellite\u2019s main computer. The smart battery will analyse the conditions and decide when to charge, output power, and disconnect itself if a payload malfunctions. The data transmission method will allow parallel data transmission, so that multiple payloads can communicate simultaneously without using the main satellite computer. This design significantly increases the reliability of satellite, since the satellite can still maintain its functionality by replacing the main satellite computer with one of the payload microcontrollers."

Using our wide range of in-house computational models we carry out direct and precise simulations, with which we complement the experimental findings and cover the broader conditions tackled by industry and nature. We use this body of observations to articulate simple and general mathematical formulae that accurately predict granular flows, accounting for the effect of grain size, shape and interaction modes. Our findings have advanced the resolution of important problems in geotechnical engineerings (prediction of landslide paths, novel and traditional foundations, etc.), geophysics (earthquake dynamics, heat balance beneath volcanoes), and mining and manufacturing (optimisation of material handling and mixing processes)."

We have innovative methods for measuring the internal velocity fields, grain size distribution and particle shape orientation as they evolve over time. These methods have led to the investigation of a large number of problems, applicable to many industries, including bulk solids handling, coffee production and fibre-reinforced concrete."

Laboratory: Particles and Grains Laboratory. The shear strength of granular materials is ultimately determined at the interface scale between two grains. Key parameters include contact stiffness, friction coefficient and capillary interaction. While connecting the microscopic quantities with the engineering applications, fitting procedures at the grain scale were often made to achieve good agreements with macroscopic benchmark experiments. Rather than using this end to justify the fitting processes, we are looking at extracting measurable material properties at the lower scale(s). In particular, we employ mechanical and chemical surface treatment for alternating the surface structure, microscopy (optical profilometer, atomic force microscopy) for characterising the surface topology, and nano-indentation for mechanical testing of the surface interaction. With the coexistence of multiple phases (solid, gas and liquid) in granular materials, we examine the dynamic interplay among them via computational (molecular dynamics, smoothed particle hydrodynamics, discrete element method, and lattice Boltzmann method) and experimental approaches developed in the lab. We are also developing numerical tools for generating, analysing and simulating rough surfaces, and finally integrate these interfacial information into a hierarchical constitutive framework to pass essential parameters (and their evolution) to the engineering scale."

Laboratories: Geotechnical Research Laboratory, DynamiX, Geo-Environmental Laboratory. The discipline of soil mechanics has historically focused on the behaviour of clayey sediments which underlie many of the world\u2019s major cities and have presented many challenges to geotechnical engineering. Considerable research to understand the behaviour of sands which form extensive deposits, particularly around the coasts of many parts of the world, has revealed that the idealised soils tested in research laboratories do not represent real soils for which particle orientation and arrangement (structure) is important. There are many man-made (mined) soils that are intermediate between clays and sands. Our research aims to better characterise these materials through careful testing in the laboratory using a range of soil testing apparatus. We conduct model experiments to evaluate the constitutive models developed from the material characterisation and use these models to investigate some challenging problems, such as understanding liquefaction in ship cargoes of mined ore materials; the onset of slope failures on submarine slopes; and the behaviour of soils subject to dynamic loading."

We're exploring the issues facing species recovery programs, and the potential benefits to be found in managing threatened species recovery from a project management perspective. Our research has uncovered eight core challenges that impact on species recovery programs, identifying that there is a general lack of integration of project management into the recovery process. This was found to be particularly evident in terms of the recovery project lifecycle, risk management, and stakeholder management. Strategies for addressing these issues are discussed. Conservation scientists typically focus on technical recovery competencies but we suggest that more is needed than just a technical focus. Managing recovery from a project management perspective will increase recovery success rates through an increased focus on the contextual and behavioural competencies that are essential to the management and delivery of recovery projects and programs."

If relationships sour in projects, a culture of blame and mistrust can rapidly develop, leading to situations where mistakes are hidden, and risks rapidly escalate. At the other end of the spectrum, when relationships work well, when stakeholders act as partners in delivery, the project process can become a source of inspiration and creativity.

A project will rarely be successful if the team of people responsible for delivery cannot work together effectively. However, project teams rarely have the luxury of long periods where positive working relationships can naturally develop over time. Projects need way of quickly developing trust and psychological safety to ensure performance. Most team building takes a one-size-fits-all approach to developing interpersonal relationships, but this can waste time trying to strengthen already strong relationships. We suggest there is a better team-building approach. It\u2019s about understanding that teams are social networks built on connections between individuals. It involves deep one-on-one conversations, designed to get people out of their comfort zones. Our research tested a personalised approach to improving project team communication and explored the impact of team development on interpersonal networks of communication. We found that a when team building is customised to respond to the specific strengths and weaknesses within a social network, team building can have a significant impact on patterns of communication in a project team, with a relatively small investment in time. Research suggests psychological safety is crucial in the workplace. There is much more to team success than simply focusing on the task at hand. Team members need to talk regularly and be comfortable raising difficult issues. Our research demonstrates how managers can enhance patterns of internal team communication in their teams, both in terms of how frequently team members talk to each other, and how comfort with difficult topics."

Increased understanding of the characteristics, experience and evolution of project-based work and careers is required to inform the attraction, development, retention and effective management of human resources. In a volatile world, characterised by change and uncertainty, work and workplaces are becoming increasingly projectified. By their nature, projects are inherently uncertain, and those who choose to pursue project based careers tend to identify more with the project than the organisation, to have high self efficacy and thrive on the challenge and opportunity that uncertainty presents. Improvements to human resource practices are required to support employees facing discontinuity and reduced security as they transition to project based roles. Project workers take responsibility for their own careers. Career progression and pathways are strongly influenced by opportunity and by interactions between the individual and their context. As work becomes increasingly projectified, understanding of the nature of project based work and careers has extended relevance. There is a need for human resource management practices to be enriched with this understanding to support employees in evolving workplaces with reduced security and to attract, develop and retain talent for increasing numbers of project based roles across all industry sectors."

Our research shows that understanding and identifying points of stakeholder influence can be better understood using a holistic model using social network theories and methodology. Improved understanding of stakeholder influence leads to better stakeholder engagement which is conducive to project delivery. It is also vital particularly in public infrastructure projects where communities are impacted because understanding stakeholder influence allows for proactive interventions that prevents the small minority that are often the most vocal and harmful to the project."

Participants comprised of professional and teaching staff, and students from the undergraduate and postgraduate subjects. The findings demonstrate that most students enjoy the workshops and interactions with their teachers while the positive learning experience is well-correlated with preparedness, increased knowledge acquisition and enhanced performance. Self-directed flipped learning still needs to be ingrained with the students. Adapting teaching resources to suit a workshop structure that focusses on application and activities, rather than content delivery resulted in heavier workloads in the initial transition."

            "The world has moved on a long way since the post-WW2 era in which project management was originally developed. We now expect projects to be nimble, agile, and able to embody the dynamic capabilities that allow us to respond to change and uncertainty. However, assumptions of stability and political simplicity still underly mindsets and many of the most popular approaches to managing projects. We\u2019re seeking to change this. We want to equip project, program, and portfolio managers with the tools they need to conceive, lead, and benefit from projects, even when they are delivered in a complex and contested world. Our research addresses issues related to. improvement of the project management process at all stages of the lifecycle, interdisciplinary collaboration, developments on processes of governance, and, ways of streamlining the management process."

Project management is generally seen as good for business, but do we actually have proof that project management has a positive impact on productivity or profitability, or are we just assuming that it does?. There is actually little published research that directly questions this assumption, which is why our research tests whether there is a relationship between the use of project management as a core business skill, and organisational productivity and profitability. We used data from over 10,000 survey responses from Australian businesses. It showed that there was a significant relationship between use of project management and business productivity, profitability, and total sales. Businesses that used project management reported sales figures that were on average three times higher than those that did not. Approximately 15% more of the survey respondents who used project management reported increasing in productivity, compared with those who didn\u2019t. Our results clearly indicated that using project management skills to undertake core business activities makes a significant contribution to financial performance."

Undertaking projects may be the organisational strategy or it may be the way in which organisational strategy is implemented. In either case, organisational capability to manage projects is either a core or enabling competence. One size fits all best practice and maturity models have been referenced as a guide to improving organisational project delivery capability. Our research questioned this approach and proposed that different organisational strategies would drive different configurations of project delivery capability. Responses from senior managers in over 400 organisations demonstrated that there are strategic drivers that are characteristic of different industry sectors giving rise to different configurations of project management capability. One size does not fit all. Rather than using generic best practice guides for development of organisational project management capability, organisations should place emphasis on those aspects of capability that are most important relative to their strategic context and drivers. In terms of benchmarking, with a view to practice improvement, results of this research provide guidance when seeking benchmarking partners."

Project management and change management have the potential to jointly contribute to the delivery of organisational changes. However, there is not much clarity about the boundary and relationship between these disciplines. Our research identifies how professionals trained in these disciplines can most effectively work together. Project management and change management contribute to very different success criteria, and professionals trained in these disciplines have very different views about what they contribute, and how the other discipline should contribute, to successful delivery. There are fundamental differences in world view between change management and project management. Our research provides practical guidelines to help project managers and change managers determining the ways these disciplines should work together to mitigate risks associated with specific critical success factors. Both of these disciplines provide essential perspectives on how organisations can achieve strategic priorities. Together, they can increase the likelihood of user uptake, senior stakeholder engagement, and successful delivery."

The resulting interdependencies make project execution difficult. Traditional project management approaches break down in the face of this sharing and there is greater need for coordination and collaboration across projects. Without this, projects executing in isolation can have unrealistic plans which are prone to \"surprises\" that result from the inter dependencies. Traditional governance suggests a program structure to group like projects, however there is evidence that in larger portfolios this does not happen. Instead, release management (part of the question and answer processes) attempts to mitigate the problems by temporal partitioning - grouping connected projects into releases. Techniques to pre-empt and manage interdependencies have the potential to: better prioritise work to drive outcomes instead of simply delivering features, increase execution efficiencies by avoiding delays caused by interdependencies related log jams, and, seek and find synergies in the portfolio to avoid duplication of effort."

The human resources equality initiatives seem to have no real impact on women's representation in those industries. However, an improved representation of women across management and non-management levels can be seen from implementation of work\u2013life initiatives. Our research also found that organisations with even low numbers of women in their top management teams are more likely to improve the effectiveness of their work\u2013life initiatives. Leveraging female talent can improve organisational competitiveness and outcomes. However, project-based organisations in those industries are missing out on the performance gains that can be derived from diversity. Our research showed that the impact of women in management on organisational performance is stronger in project-based organisations than in non-project-based organisations. Large Australian organisations are required to develop formal initiatives to embrace equality and diversity. However, our research found that leaders tend to select equality and diversity initiatives based on legislative and industry requirements rather than developing a strategic business approach, remaining limited by indifference to the substantive issues of equality and diversity, reinforcing systemic inequalities."

Several megatrends influence development, of which digitisation, urbanisation, globalisation and the increasing focus on sustainability and value may be among the most important for construction (WEF 2016, Blanco et al. 2018). One key to handling the future challenges is collaboration and has therefore emerged as a focus area for development in the industry and research. It is time to look at how we design processes and contracts for the future. Our report presents research on how public clients should prepare to enter such collaboration and what needs to be done before entering a collaborative contract. The research in this report views projects from a client perspective (interviews) and attempts to answer two questions. What are the necessary preconditions for successful relationship-based contracting?, How can we prepare for a successful collaborative contract?, Download the report to learn more."

            "The John Grill Institute for Project Leadership is a global leader in rigorous research that rethinks the many ways we conceive, lead, and benefit from projects. Founded through a generous donation by John Grill, we are recognised in Australia and internationally as a hub for research and research-led executive education on project leadership. Drawing on the strong research base at the University of Sydney, the John Grill Institute for Project Leadership is focused on building leadership capacity to transform the performance of projects, transcending industry boundaries to learn across different kinds of projects \u2013 such as organisational transformation, software and infrastructure projects. We are developing new insight on project leadership, sponsorship, governance and management, how it is distributed within and across organisations, how projects engage with stakeholders, and how emerging new forms of leadership create value for society. Key objectives. We work with our alumni and our partners to create a trusted forum for communication and creating opportunities to learn from each other, and to come together and address the issues that stop our partners from gaining the full value from the projects in which they invest. We are: building a new trajectory of research education to generate insights into the delivery of value through project organising, delivering world-class executive education to project leaders and project sponsors and working with and supporting our growing network of alumni as they lead projects, engaging with industry, government, policy and communities to co-create research agendas and to have an impact on project set-up and delivery in a changing world.",
            "In a rapidly changing and uncertain world, projects are becoming the way that work is done. We see projects as interventions with far-reaching social and economic impacts. However, the rate of underperformance of projects is uncomfortably high, as is the flow-on effect of wasted time, money, and social capital invested. Our research and executive education aims to explore the reasons behind these phenomena, many of which can largely be attributed to increasing project complexity, and a limited human capacity to make decisions under uncertainty. For our global benchmark, see this recent guide from the Association of Project Management."

Considering that dysregulation of cell mass is a critical underlying force in the development of many diseases, understanding how cells regulate their mass has enormous potential to transform the way we diagnose, monitor and treat disease conditions such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, ageing or infectious diseases."

Cancer cells have a highly stressful microenvironment, which is often mechanically stiff. The stiff tumour microenvironment can result in a variety of signalling events, which can affect critical cell survival pathways required for cancer progression and metastasis. Advance microscopy and nanomechanical tools will be used to determine the profiling of the matrix mechanics.

Understanding the mechanism of electrical conduction through cardiac tissue is essential for maintaining the function of the heart because conduction abnormalities are known to potentially lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. The materials will be characterised using the standard analytical techniques and will be tested for bioactivity using a range of in-vitro studies using cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes).

These are inadequate due to limited success rates, donor site morbidity, sacrifice of a functional nerve and difficult surgery. Functional regeneration of peripheral nerve is hindered by factors such as inadequate extracellular matrix formation and insufficient/reduced neurotrophic factors. In this project, we will utilise engineered biomaterials and nanomaterials to mimic the 3D microenvironment and explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for modulating the process of nerve repair/regeneration."

Confocal microscopy with high content analysis (HCA) is a new technology that is being adopted in the field of bioengineering, health technologies and cell biology research. The combination of confocal microscopy and high content analysis can enable quantitative measurement of cellular activity to a greater extent. Simultaneous quantification of these changes along with high-resolution image acquisition can decipher some of the innate cellular responses with greater precision and throughput than traditional confocal microscopy. The project involves fully integrated confocal imaging, acquisition and the simultaneous high throughput quantitative analysis of various cell functions."

With a high photoluminescence quantum yield and strong photostability in a high ionic strength environment, we demonstrate the versatility of the carbon dots by employing them as low-toxicity fluorescent labels and for semi-quantitative and selective sensing of Fe3+ in cancer cells."

Great advances in biological tissue labeling and automated microscopic imaging have revolutionised how biologists visualise molecular, sub-cellular, cellular and super-cellular structures and study their respective functions. How to interpret such image datasets in a quantitative and automatic way has become a major challenge in current computational biology. The essential methods of bioimage informatics involve generation, visualisation, analysis and management. This project aims to develop novel algorithms for content analysis in microscopic images, such as segmentation of cell nuclei, detection of certain cell structures and tracing of cell changes over time. Such algorithms would be valuable in turning image data into useful biological knowledge. These studies will focus on computer vision methodologies in feature extraction and learning-based modelling. Neuroimaging computing in automated detection of the longitudinal brain changes. Neuroimaging technologies, such as MRI, have transformed how we study the brain under normal or pathological conditions. As imaging facilities become increasingly accessible, more and more imaging data are collected from patients with chronic disorders in longitudinal settings. Such big neuroimaging data enables new possibilities to study the brain with high translational impact, such as early detection of the longitudinal changes in the brain, and large-scale evaluation of imaging-based biomarkers. This project aims to develop novel computational methods to automatically detect the longitudinal changes in the brain based on large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging data, using machine-learning and deep-learning techniques. Context modelling for large-scale medical image retrieval. Content-based medical image retrieval is a valuable mechanism to assist patient diagnosis. Different from text-based search engines, the similarity of images is evaluated based on a comparison between visual features. Consequently, how to best encode the complex visual features in a comparable mathematic form is crucial. Different from the image retrieval techniques proposed for general imaging in the medical domain, disease-specific contexts need to be modelled as the retrieval target. This project aims to study the various techniques of visual feature extraction and context modeling in medical imaging, and to develop new methodologies for content-based image retrieval of various medical applications."

This project will use a deep learning approach for predictive, prognostic prediction of patient treatment outcomes of malignant brain tumors. The multi-layer convolution of CNN will be utilised for detection and segmentation of tumors/lesions, and the project will include the investigation on the effective features for training and design of more feasible deep learning scheme for treatment outcomes prediction.

Comprehensive and possibly complementary information embedded in the multimodality images is of great importance for accurate clinical decision-making. Our project aims to develop collaborative learning algorithms to incorporate important features from multimodality images with prior domain knowledge and optimal ultimate solutions to automated subject identification and segmentation. Content-oriented deformable image registration. Image registration is a fundamental image processing technique, which spatially registers images that may be obtained from multiple sensors, at different times, or at different view angles. Current image registration methods are either based on image intensity information or based on the extracted feature to derive deformation field. These registration schemas may introduce excessive deformation onto the local important regions, in which the local features are expected to be preserved. Our research focuses on deriving deformation fields according to the image contents for more meaningful and sensible registration. We use temporal medical images as testing data for our research. Fusion and analytics of omics data. Clinical testing and assessment in adjunction with diverse medical imaging data are the basis for more effective patient treatment and management. However, how to fully utilise the widely-available omics data including genomics, clinical characteristics, systemic immunity and radiomics is yet to investigate for individualised treatment. This project aims to analyse these multi-stream life data with visual analytics techniques and transform these analyses to our understanding of human health and disease pattern for prognostic medicine."

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the western world. Recently \u2018clot-busting\u2019 thrombolytic drugs have become available for when the stroke is associated with a blockage or ischaemia, however bleeding or haemorrhage must be excluded before therapy can commence. To assess new treatments and manage dosage of thrombolytic drugs, a device to continuously monitor bleeding in the brain would be a great advantage. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a relatively new imaging method that traditionally uses a ring of external electrodes to image impedance changes in 2D within the body. The technology is currently available for clinical application for pulmonary ventilation monitoring and we have developed methods to allow detection of perfusion in the lungs. There is also clinical need to image the heart in intensive care, but physicians find echocardiograms difficult due to the presence of bone and the ventilated state of the lungs. The resolution of EIT is limited by the number of measurements, electrode location and the 2D nature of acquisition. For providing the optimum information on cardiac function it is important to measure a sufficient number of frames within a single cardiac cycle. This project aims to increase the measurement speed, use of internal electrodes and other methods to improve image resolution."

Industry partners: Westmead Hospital; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. There is an urgent clinical need to develop diagnostic devices to assess the health of newborn babies. While the care and survival of newborns is constantly improving, brain damage from bleeding or haemorrhage is still common in preterm infants and can lead to poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including cerebral palsy. In the developing world, the World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition contributes to more than half of child deaths, and has called for a low-cost device to measure malnutrition. In collaboration with the newborn care unit (NICU) at Westmead Hospital, we have developed an improved detection of intraventricular haemorrhage. By using signal processing and data analytics of blood pressure we were able to predict the onset of bleeding within 10 minutes which can potentially provide the caregivers with more time to adjust treatment and reduce the risk of severity of brain injury. Low fat composition in newborns exposes them to an immediate risk of increased mortality and morbidity, and to diabetes and obesity diseases in later life. We have also developed a portable and easy-to-use device that uses light to measure the amount of fat under the skin so that infants don't need to be placed in a scanner or have a skin pinch test. The device can be made inexpensively with only five sensors and the length or height of the infant does not need to be measured, avoiding a difficult measurement of infants who wriggle and protest at being held flat. The device will enable health workers trying to identify malnourished infants and monitor changes in the nutritional status of an infant who has received interventions. We are working alongside the University of Oxford\u2019s INTERBIO-21st study to test their prototype device for suitability in different skin tones and in large communities in Africa."

We aim to restore sight to the blind through electrical stimulation of nerves inside the retina \u2013 an approach akin to the way that cochlear implants provide an effective treatment of deafness. Over time we have amassed considerable expertise in this area of research and we are internationally recognised leaders in the burgeoning field of bionic eyes. Realising the promise in this new technology and the potential of the team to bring it to fruition, the Australian Government provided $50 million from 2010\u201314 to support the development of a bionic eye for the blind. Following this, the National Health and Medical Research Council has provided funding for this pioneering work to reach the clinic. The outcomes of this important initiative have exceeded expectations. The unique approach of placing a stimulating electrode into a particular location within the eye known as the supra-choroidal space defied many critics. It was shown to be effective in allowing three blind people with advanced cases of a disease known as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) to see spots of light called \u2018phosphenes\u2019 when implanted with an early prototype array connected to external electronics. The phosphenes could be arranged to form patterned vision that exchanged darkness for light, and essentially brought blind eyes back to life. The next steps will see the fabrication and testing of a fully implantable device that significantly increases the number of stimulation channels for improved patterned vision. This device is called the Phoenix 99 Bionic Eye System and is currently undergoing its pre-clinical testing."

We are working to develop an implantable device to serve as a therapeutic treatment to facial nerve paralysis (FNP). Patients with FNP are unable to close their eyelid, most commonly on one eye only. Eyelid closure failures can result in corneal ulcers and may ultimately lead to blindness, in addition to the significant social challenges associated with this highly-conspicuous disability. The desired solution will detect the closure of the functional eyelid and initiate closure of the paralysed eyelid in a natural motion that hydrates the cornea and manages the issues relating to cosmesis. A multi-faceted project called BLINC (Bionic Lid Implant for Natural Closure) includes research and development of an implantable actuator, a surgically-implanted \u2018sling\u2019, externally-supplied power and triggering system, and a network of smart sensors to synchronise the eye closure with the contralateral, healthy eye. The enabling technologies will underpin new and improved applications of in-vivo imaging in animals and humans via highly interdisciplinary projects involving physics, engineering and robotics, computer modelling, algorithm design and animal models. Our ultimate goal is to translate the discoveries we make in the laboratory into improved clinical understanding and treatment of debilitating diseases affecting the brain and mind."

This critical technology gap is stifling progress in understanding the biological mechanisms underpinning mood disorders, drug addiction and deficits in learning, motor function and speech. Our team is developing a new generation of positron emission tomography (PET) scanner that is specifically tailored for accurate quantification of biological processes in the brains of freely moving mice.

This pressing need has led to the rise of \u2018tissue engineering and regenerative medicine\u2019, a multidisclinary field which aims to induce the body\u2019s natural regenerative abilities and produce functional substitutes of biological tissue for clinical use. The fundamental concept combines various tissue engineering elements, most often a scaffold as a supporting matrix in combination with living cells and/or bioactive molecules, to form a tissue engineering construct that repairs or regenerates the diseased or damaged tissue or organ. Advances in medical technology have contributed to the world\u2019s ageing population and increased life expectancies. Unfortunately, this has also caused a drastic increase in musculoskeletal conditions impacting bones, joints and tendons, which impose annual costs of $5.7 billion on the Australian healthcare system. The demand for bone graft substitutes is estimated to increase by 30 percent from 2013 to 2020. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine can provide a novel treatment regime based on the use of synthetic biomaterials, which may be constructed into three-dimensional implants and combined with biologics (such as cells and/or bioactive molecules). This will positively impact the quality of life of millions of people who are affected by musculoskeletal conditions globally."

One of the major focuses of our research is developing renewable and biodegradable plastics that can be used as an alternative to the non-degradable polymers currently used on a commercial scale. So far the team has recovered renewable products from food waste and used them as an additive/filler to enhance the mechanical properties of biodegradable plastics. Recent work has demonstrated the superior properties of these biodegradable polymers for packaging food, including the low permeability to oxygen and water vapour compared to current commercial non-degradable polymers. The project will provide a sustainable and economically feasible method to convert agricultural waste into high-value bioplastics, benefiting both the agribusiness sector, which is faced with a growing waste problem, and the packaging sector, which is limited by its dependence on toxic, non-degradable polymers."

The team is currently in the process of developing low-cost vitamin K-added product formulations for human and animal consumption. By infusing chicken feed with vitamin K2, our researchers will make chickens healthier and more productive in laying nutrient\u2013rich eggs. The use of menadione-added chicken feed substantially decreases chicken bone density and creates issues for animal welfare and commercial productivity. To tackle this problem, our researchers are working to fortify chicken feed with vitamin K. They have shown that feed enriched with vitamin K makes chickens healthier and more profitable by increasing bone density, overall lifetime and egg-laying productivity. From a consumer perspective, eggs enriched with a bioavailable and stable source of vitamin K are healthier."

The team has demonstrated that certain bacteria and/or fungi \u2013 essential in the production of industrial enzymes \u2013 can be cultured on a hull waste-based substrate. They are currently assessing the enzyme yield and activity from selected microbes grown in the submerged and/or solid-state hull cultures.

Colorimetric gas sensors that detect early release of gases from food spoilage are of great importance in food safety and food conservation. Yet, such sensors are not broadly implemented as they are incompatible with food packaging and non-functional at the low temperatures at which food is stored. To achieve a suitable colorimetric food sensor, it is essential to optimise the extent of colour change, design the fabrication process to be suitable for large scale manufacturing, and fabricate sensors that are active at sub-zero temperature. Such sensors will be an invaluable tool for detection of food spoilage and will benefit packaging industry, consumers, and producers."

On average 7.5 million tons of food is wasted in Australia every year, with householders throwing away in excess of $8 billion worth of food annually. It has been estimated that two third of the food waste can be avoidable if there were food sensors capable of evaluating the quality of food along the supply chain. Such exacerbated wastages along with the exponentially increasing world population (9.8 billion by 2050) requires the food industry not only to produce enough food, but also to minimise the food loss, implement rigorous food safety regulations, and address the environmental side effects of their operations. These newly evolved challenges in food industry can be addressed by biodegradable smart packaging where the package is not a simple passive barrier anymore but can monitor the quality of food over time, provide traceability and network connectivity, and is biodegradable with minimal environmental footprints."

They have the potential to produce a wide range of bioactive compounds which can be applied in the food industry. Examples of this include omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins and carotenoid pigments. A key advantage of using microalgae to produce these compounds is that they are photosynthetic, meaning they use sunlight and carbon dioxide as their major inputs. This makes any potential process highly sustainable, which is increasingly important given the pressing need for green production technologies. We aim to develop new processes using microalgae to produce the compounds we need. We have successfully developed pilot-scale processes for the production of vitamin K1 as well as lutein and we are currently exploring translational pathways for industrial uptake."

Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for infants in the first six months of life, as infants are immuno-incompetent at birth and rely on the immune functionality of the breastmilk and the mothers immune system to provide the necessary protection until their immune system has developed sufficiently. When mothers are unable to breastfeed, a reliable, high quality alternative source must be found. Current processing techniques in milk banks only allow for small batch processing with a short-shelf life of donor milk, and thermal pasteurisation reduces the immune functionality. Consequently, this donor milk is very difficult to access. We aim to improve the processing of donor milk to extend shelf-life, and quality of donor milk in order to make it a widely available resource to mothers."

Our collaborators: Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company Ltd. The gut microbiota interacts closely with the host and its nutrition, eliciting profound impacts on host health. There is great interest in promoting microbial-dependent health benefits by manipulating the carbohydrate profile of food, especially by increasing dietary fibre content. A key challenge of this is understanding why dietary fibre supplementation does not produce the same microbial response and health benefits in all individuals. We hypothesise that different types of dietary fibre and the interactive effects with other diet components shape microbial interactions. To test this hypothesis, we functionally categorised carbohydrates and dietary fibre into four types based on host and microbial-accessibility. We are investigating ten carbohydrate profiles of four dietary contexts, enabling us to map the effects of dietary nutrition to the gut microbial composition, diversity and activity, as well as impacts on host physiology, metabolism and immunity. We aim to gain a perspective on the microbial and host responses to diet, allowing targeted diet manipulations to modify the gut microbiota and influence host health in personal dietary choices and treatment therapies."

Understanding the complex interactions in this community is difficult and performing experiments can be very challenging. We aim to develop lab and computer-based models of the gut microbiome. The end goal of this project is to develop a tool which can be used to simulate the interactions between microbes in the gut.

We aim to develop and validate cutting-edge computational tools which can be used to simulate the stomach.

Computing and audio research consists of three main areas: spatial audio, audio engineering and bioacoustic engineering. Spatial audio explores elements including how humans localise sounds, the effect of room acoustics on sound perception and generation of augmented and virtual reality audio. Our collaboration with the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory and the Acoustics Research Laboratory at the University of Sydney forges a strong research alliance in this field. Audio engineering investigates audio signal processing and applications of machine learning to acoustic signals. It includes the study of morphoacoustics: the study of the relationship between physical structures, their acoustic properties, and perception. In this area, we are working with the Politecnico di Milano to study violin acoustics and with the University of York to study the acoustics of the vocal tract. Bioacoustic engineering explores the development of hardware and algorithms to measure and classify bioacoustic signals as well as acoustic stimulation using ultrasound. Our ultrasound research focuses on nanoparticle stimulation, sonoporation, and high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU)."

            "Image processing involves the development of novel theories and algorithms to capture, process, analysis and understand the images. This important and challenging research brings together experts from a range of fields to address fundamental signal-processing issues for which the input is an image, a series of images or a video. The most widely used image-processing application is Adobe Photoshop, and important applications can also be found in medicine, remote sensing and robot vision. New technologies to improve image and video capture and analysis. Our experts: Professor Dacheng Tao, Dr Chang Xu, Dr Tongliang Liu. Industry partners: UBTech, Toyota and Huawei. Conventional image processing depends on domain knowledge to analyse images, identify filters and develop transformation, and pre-processing. Beyond this, modern image processing powered by deep learning, with the abundance of high-performance computing resources and big data, is gathering steam. This project systematically studies deep-learning-based image processing, from the establishment of fundamental deep-learning theories to understanding the parameter structure of deep networks. We design network optimisation techniques, develop generic deep learning components for image-processing tasks (for example, image deblur and haze removing), and construct elegant, deep-network architectures for high-level image analysis and understanding (such as image classification, face recognition, and human pose recognition). More than 120 papers have been published in prestigious journals and prominent conferences related to image processing, such as the Institute of Electrical and Eclectronics Engineers Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence; Transactions on Image Processing; Computer Vision and Image Understanding; Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; European Conference on Computer Vision; and the International Conference on Computer Vision. Our technical achievements have been examined through practical challenges; for example, our significant successes in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2015 and 2017 demonstrated our technical expertise in this industry. This challenge, known as the \u2018world cup\u2019 in computer vision and machine learning, is where the latest technologies in image understanding are demonstrated and promoted, and the competition typically attracts strong attention from industry.",

These problems have applications in many fields, such as mathematics, biology, robotics, operations research and social networks. Our focus research is to narrow the gap between theory and practice and develop practical algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees. To achieve this aim we use a multitude of frameworks, such as: approximation algorithms, randomised algorithms, realistic input models, and, multivariate complexity."

Nowadays devices can join and leave at any given time and must operate in the presence of complex obstacles that disrupt communication, such as electromagnetic fields in wireless networks. We intend to develop innovative methods to deliver the outcome of provably efficient routing in obstacle-rich environments. This will enable faster data gathering in sensor networks used in geographical and geological operations, such as earthquake detection and prediction."

Graph drawing algorithms aim to produce human-readable pictures of relational data. These algorithms are used in visualisation software underlying many data mining tools, in domains such as market surveillance, fraud detection, bioinformatics, software re-engineering, and counter-terrorism. Planar graphs are fundamental for both graph theory and graph algorithms and are extensively studied. Structural properties and fundamental algorithms for planar graphs have been discovered. However, most real-world graphs, such as social networks and biological networks, are non-planar. To analyse and visualise such real-world networks, it is necessary to solve fundamental mathematical and algorithmic research questions on sparse non-planar graphs, called beyond planar graphs. New algorithms for beyond planar graphs will be in high demand by practitioners in various application domains to solve complex visualisation problems."

We are investigating a new multiplane framework, which draws graphs using a set of 2D planes, nicely arranged in three dimensions, and satisfying new aesthetic criteria derived from topology and graph theory. More specifically, we aim to study multiplane embeddings from both mathematical and computational points of view: define new mathematical criteria for multiplane embeddings and establish lower/upper bounds, characterise multiplane graphs, determine the complexity of computing multiplane embeddings, and, design algorithms for constructing multiplane embeddings."

Due to the massive success of virtualisation, more and more services will be run inside virtualised data centres to reduce both operational (OPEX) and capital expenditures (CAPEX). Aligned with the general trend of migrating traditional IT architectures to clouds (public or private), the next generation of telecommunication (Telecom) networks, such as 5G, are also expected to run on virtualised environments. In these environments network functions are deployed through virtual machines instead of current proprietary boxes. Guaranteeing the performance of such virtualised systems is challenging, however, because it requires accurate modelling and efficient optimisation of such services in their new environments. This theme also deals with solving a wide range of problems that are related to cloud computing (and data centres) technologies. These problems include: resource allocation and scheduling, self-optimisation techniques, quality of service and data management, accountability and provenance, secure application isolation, energy-aware algorithms, autonomic management protocols, service-level agreements. The efficient solution of these problems should lead to environmentally friendly green cloud systems. The addition of energy or power as an added constraint makes the above problems more complex. Moreover, the solution of these problems should lead to delivery of the required performance levels and minimises energy usage between all the components of a cloud environment simultaneously. However, any solution needs to be holistic in nature, taking into account all of the above issues along with the appropriate gluing tools that can lead to efficient, yet transparent solutions that don\u2019t require continuous intervention from human operators."

Today more and more companies are faced with a huge amount of streaming data that needs to be quickly processed in real time to extract meaningful information. As a concrete example, big enterprises apply sophisticated machine learning algorithms to extract deeper insights from the raw data that continuously enter their systems. Two of the most popular platforms that can be used for real-time streaming data processing are Apache Storm and Apache Spark. In both systems a huge amount of data must be analysed/transformed continuously in the main memory units before it is stored on the hard drive. One of the major issues posed by such platforms is keeping the promised QoS level under fluctuations of request rates. Past research showed that the presence of high-arrival rate of streaming data within short periods can cause serious degradation to the overall performance of the underlying system. In this project we are developing advanced controller techniques for famous streaming data processing engines such as Apache Storm, Apache Spark and Dask platform to best allocate computing resources. Our main goal is to preserve the QoS enforced by end users while keep the resources throughput at an optimal level."

Workload consolidation (either using virtualisation techniques or container-based methods) has attracted much attention in big cloud data centres in recent times. In this project, we try to find the best trade-off to reaching efficient energy consumption among shared resources. We are also seeking an optimised performance level of running collocated applications in a modern data centre that normally contains thousands of multi/many core boxes within a future cloud computing infrastructure. Past research has shown that performance interference due to shared resources across co-located virtual machines makes today's cloud computing paradigm inadequate for performance-sensitive applications, and more expensive than necessary for the others. To satisfy service quality demanded by customers, cloud providers have to deploy virtual machines in more physical machines (than actually is needed) to achieve a better resource isolation, which in turn adversely consumes higher levels of energy. Hence, a challenging problem for providers is identifying (and managing) performance interference between the VMs that are co-located at any given PM. In this project we aim to propose consolidation algorithms to reduce energy consumption of a given data centre and avoid system performance degradation, with a focus on the impact of shared resources such as last level cash (LLC), and so on."

The aim of this project is to investigate the optimal scheduling of bag-of-task applications in hybrid cloud environments (comprising both private and public resources) in the presence of heavy-tailed and bursty traffic. This traffic model is considerably different from traditional arrival traffic patterns,which can be modelled using Poisson or Markov-modulated processes. However, empirical evidence supported by deep analysis on workload of today\u2019s applications in several grid and cloud environments showed that the traffic of tasks' arrival is intrinsically bursty and exhibits correlations over longer time scales than the traditional models. In such scenarios that involve applications with heavy-tailed running time tasks, there are relatively few studies on the problem of task scheduling on hybrid cloud resources. One of the key considerations in the design of such a scheduling policy is the concept of Pareto-optimality of multiple objective functions, such as total incurring cost and/or makespan. The output of this project will include an implementation of a suggested scheduling algorithm in the real cloud environment, with deep analysis of several well-known workload patterns."

We investigate, for example, approximation algorithms that give a quality bound on the solution (where the computed schedule is no worse than 50 percent of the optimal schedule). We use techniques such as linear programming, probabilistic algorithms, convex optimisation and other methods to get a handle on these algorithmic problems. We also look at data mining and big data analytics where there is a need for techniques to handle the massive data sets and be able to scale statistical inference to large and high dimensional data sets. Towards this end, we leverage techniques from distributed computing to scale computations to previously unimaginable levels."

This massive volume of data has the potential to generate new opportunities for the understanding of natural, engineering and human systems and can lead to extraordinary new knowledge and discoveries in many fields of application. However, analysing this massive volume of data with exponential growth is not a trivial task. Since its birth in the 1980s the rough sets theory has proven to be a useful tool for data analysis, and a wide variety of rough sets algorithms were implemented in scientific and commercial tools for data processing; however, they are very time consuming when data sets are in a large scale. This project aims to investigate how to leverage rough sets calculations through field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), to support massive data-intensive applications."

A complex network\u2019s topology plays an important role in determining how the network can resist random and targeted attacks. It has been shown by prominent researchers that the so-called scale-free networks display high resilience to random attacks, and this is perhaps partly the reason for most of the \u2018real-world\u2019 networks in any domain being scale free. Yet scale-free networks are vulnerable to targeted attacks. It is possible to design network topologies so that they display high levels of tolerance to both random and targeted attacks. However, quantifying the robustness and attack tolerance of a network topology is necessary to achieve this goal. This project will attempt to define robustness measures for complex networks, which are particularly useful in sustained attack scenarios, and test their effectiveness in various domains, including computer networks, the Internet and World Wide Web, social networks and biological networks inside organisms."

Unlike traditional NoSQL databases that use the Linux/OS file system that was built for rotational drives, modern NoSQL engines (such as Aerospike) bypass the native OS filesystem and have implemented their own systems to access solid-state drives directly. This capability makes it great for achieving high throughput for both reads and writes. Past experiments showed that it can easily hit one million writes per second with only 50 servers. On the other hand, the Amazon EC2 Instance Store provides a unique opportunity for a user to lease a temporary instance that the SSD storage attaches to the host computer physically. This means that now you can lease a powerful i2.xlarge computing instance with more than 60 cores and an SSD storage attached to the computing engine with very low latency, for only ~$3/hour in a PAYG fashion. In this project our aim is to propose a cost-effective solution for using the above-mentioned promising technologies to handle the burst of read/write traffics coming into a system with big-data attributes."

Optimisation algorithms can be used to solve a wide range of problems that arise in the design and operation of distributed computing environments (for example, data mining, scheduling and routing). However, the many classical optimisation techniques (for example, linear programming) are not suited for solving parallel processing problems due to their restricted nature. This project is investigating the application of some new and unorthodox optimisation techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, deep learning and others. However, these techniques are computationally intensive and require enormous computing time. Distributed computing has the potential to reduce the computational load and enable the efficient use of these techniques to solve a wide variety of problems."

Circular trading collusion is one method of market manipulation, and involves two or more traders to trade large volumes between themselves with a small net change of stock ownership. It becomes very hard to detect when the collusion has large groups of participants. This project will investigate and create an algorithm to detect n-party circular trading in the stock market with a very large number of traders. We use graph theory to formulate the problem and design parallel algorithm and efficiently process the graph, to find possible collusions."

In complex networks, the ability to function effectively arises not from individual components of that network, but from the way they interact. This means a complex network cannot be completely understood by examining each of its parts in isolation. The structure and function of such networks are tightly coupled: the structure evolves due to function, and function is constrained by structure. Networks of friendship and advice within organisations can determine the success of teams and failure of mergers. The structure of interorganisational relationships and supply chains influences the resilience of the national economy to natural disasters and opportunities for industrial innovation. Social network analysis can reveal the mechanisms of dynamic interactions between webs of interpersonal or inter-organisational networks and their technological and natural environment. Analysing social networks can show where to intervene to improve organisational learning, coordination, performance and resilience to shocks. Humans have always formed networks through their relationships before the internet and social networking sites such as Facebook existed. However new technologies are changing the way we live and work. It is still not fully understood how new transportation infrastructure reshapes people\u2019s social networks and connect or fragment communities. How does information communication technology unite or isolate people? How do modern technology-enabled interpersonal and inter-organisational networks further affect the development, diffusion and adoption of new technologies?."

            "Modern smart cities, infrastructure and ecosystems are susceptible to abrupt, large-scale and disruptive dynamics. Cascading power failures, traffic disruptions, epidemic outbreaks, financial and housing market crashes, and ecosystem collapses are all manifestations of critical phenomena. Our aim is to produce new cross-disciplinary methods for understanding and managing complex systems, based on information theory, distributed and high-performance computation, network theory, agent-based simulation, dynamical systems, game theory, machine learning, computational epidemiology, econophysics and systems biology. This cross-disciplinary research leverages our expertise in engineering and computational sciences and involves collaborations across physics, mathematics, biology and social sciences. Research outcomes have an impact on diverse areas such as: disaster and emergency management, large-scale epidemic modelling, organisational and social risk management, economic crisis forecasting, the stability of power grids, communication and transport systems. Our research. The Complex Systems group brings together several areas that investigate and innovate with complexity, including the Centre for Complex Systems, the Centre for Translational Data Science and the Centre for Distributed and High Performance Computing. Our key research areas are guided self-organisation (GSO) and complex networks. We are also involved in several international collaborations related to complex systems. Guided self-organisation and critical dynamics. Self-organisation is the evolution of a system into an organised form, in the absence of external influences. It brings many attractive properties to systems, such as robustness, adaptability and scalability. Self-organising systems can be found almost everywhere: neuronal ensembles self-organise into complex spike patterns; schools of fish change shape in response to approaching predators; and ecosystems develop spatial structures in response to diminishing resources. The goal of guided self-organisation (GSO) is to leverage the strengths of self-organisation (that is, its simplicity, parallelisation, adaptability, robustness and scalability) while still being able to direct the outcome of the self-organising process. We approach GSO by examining the information processing within complex systems, especially near-phase transitions and critical regimes. We use information-theoretic measures of complexity, criticality, and computation (\u201cinformation dynamics\u201d) and develop cross-disciplinary methods, relating information theory and thermodynamics (\u201cinformation thermodynamics\u201d), as well as game theory and complex networks.",
            "Complex networks. Networks are ubiquitous in today\u2019s world. Communication networks are changing the way we live and interact. Social networks are redefining the ways we keep in touch. Transport networks give us access to the remotest parts of the world. The energy needed for our domestic and industrial use is supplied by electric power networks. Human survival depends on the functioning of a number of biological and ecological networks. In complex networks the ability to function effectively arises not from individual nodes of that network, but from the way they interact. This means a complex network cannot be completely understood by examining each of its parts in isolation, and that the structure and function of such networks are tightly coupled: function is constrained by structure and structure evolves due to function. Research into the structure, function, evolution, and design of complex networks has wide-ranging applications, from epidemiological modelling to optimising distributed computation.",

A complex network\u2019s topology plays an important role in determining how the network can resist random and targeted attacks. It has been shown that scale-free networks display high resilience to random attacks, and yet these networks are vulnerable to targeted attacks. Is it possible to design network topologies so that they display high levels of tolerance to both types of attacks? This project attempts to define robust measures for complex networks that are particularly useful in sustained attack scenarios, and test their effectiveness in various domains, including computer networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web, social networks, and biological networks inside organisms."

Each project team is tasked with creating practical solutions to real engineering problems that have been submitted by leading commercial engineering companies and government organisations. Student consultants meet with their client organisation at the commencement of the project to understand its needs and agree to timeframes and deliverables. From there, student consultants are expected to hold client progress meeting throughout the duration of the project, as well as provide their client organisation with: project charters, regular communications and reporting, industry site visits, and, a final business report that encompasses the agreed deliverables. The outcomes of this project will ultimately be presented to the client organisation for official client sign-off. Each project is designed to enhance our students understanding about the nature of professional practice whilst also providing a valuable service to the community and industry.",

In lieu of the traditional 12-week summer placements between third and fourth years, PEP requires our students to complete a minimum 600 hours of in-curricular and extra-curricular activities, including: industry site visits, engineering and computer science conferences, non-engineering extra-curricular activities such as volunteering, work experience, and, a minimum six-week internship during your final year. This combination of experiences is designed to enhance your technical engineering-focused skills development, transferable skills development and professional engineering practice in industry. Self-reflection and peer review are also both central to the program\u2019s success, as it encourages our engineering students to draw links between their experiences and learning to purposefully identify where they have opportunity to develop interpersonal and professional skills. Student progress is monitored and assessed through a series of workshops that must be completed every semester."

Biomedical engineers design and manufacture implantable medical devices, including orthopaedic, cardiovascular and drug delivery systems. Bionic organs, robotic limbs, heart assist pumps and heart valves delivered in non-invasive day-surgery procedures are just some of the latest innovations they have brought to the world in recent years. Some biomedical engineers work on future technologies such as tissue-engineered tissues and organs, or improve the designs of therapeutic devices such as bionic limbs for the injured and people with disabilities. External medical devices such as medical imaging equipment and augmented reality technology, as well as data-oriented solutions such as e-medicine, help doctors diagnose and treat patients.",
            "Work with surgeons and technical staff in the public or private hospital systems, or for organisations that design and manufacture medical devices, or as a part of a research team looking to solve medical problems. Combine your aptitude for engineering with a passion to help and people with illnesses or disabilities. Become a design engineer, prosthetist, chief technical officer, tissue engineer, medical device assessor, forensic engineer or patent examiner, among many other career options. Perfect for people who like problem solving and investigating how things work in detail. A career with growing demand. Emerging technologies can be applied to meet the health challenges of the future. A recession-proof career. While people may spend less on cars, appliances, infrastructure and construction in hard times, healthcare is an essential service.
