These arise because the heat transfers from solar radiation and other heat fluxes at the surface are approximately uniform spatially; however the depth decreases towards the shore. This results in greater volumetric heating (daytime) or cooling (night time) so that the shallow part becomes warmer/cooler than the deeper part.

We will study a new paradigm, which is adaptive in the sense of <i>demand following generation. </i>The load devices contribute to overall balancing and welfare of the system in processes of demand response and load control. Thus future <i>smart loads</i>, using advanced power electronics, and the control and communication systems must themselves be adaptive to the dynamically changing power generation and circumstances.</p><p>The four research teams will be led by internationally renowned experts in the key areas: power systems, power electronics, computer networking and control technology.

By integrating these areas in a balanced way, the aim is to build a unique research capability which can support the future industry in the Pearl River Region and beyond.

We design network optimisation techniques, develop generic deep learning components for image-processing tasks (for example, image deblur and haze removing), and construct elegant, deep-network architectures for high-level image analysis and understanding (such as image classification, face recognition, and human pose recognition).</p><p>More than 120 papers have been published in prestigious journals and prominent conferences related to image processing, such as the Institute of Electrical and Eclectronics Engineers Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence; Transactions on Image Processing; Computer Vision and Image Understanding; Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; European Conference on Computer Vision; and the International Conference on Computer Vision.</p><p>Our technical achievements have been examined through practical challenges; for example, our significant successes in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2015 and 2017 demonstrated our technical expertise in this industry.

They used stereo cameras on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles to gather overlapping images of a shipwreck, and processed these with the aid of a Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping algorithm to create a three-dimensional model of the site.\u00a0</p><p>As a result of the mapping work, archaeologists and technical experts from the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) recently made a ground-breaking discovery; a 2000-year-old human skeleton (100BC). This is the first to be recovered from an ancient shipwreck since the introduction of DNA studies.</p><p>This latest discovery consists of a partial skull with three teeth, two arm bones, several rib pieces and two femurs, likely originating from the same person. The skeleton contains petrous bones\u2014dense nuggets behind the ear which are more likely to preserve DNA than other parts of the body.

What this recent find might tell us about the lives of people who lived in 100BC is significant, particularly as excavation work continues in the hopes of finding more bones; made possible by the University of Sydney\u2019s ground-work.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

However, I found over time an appreciation for electrical engineering; I was curious about the things I was building and I wondered how they had been designed. I looked up to engineers who are able to make decisions about how to build something and know that it will work and perform its purpose.</p><h3><strong>What do you enjoy most about your current role at TransGrid?</strong></h3><p>I am really passionate about creating, designing, managing, and building big infrastructure. I like to be able to stand outside and see a large electricity substation, solar farm, railway line, or transmission line that I have worked on. It\u2019s amazing to be a part of a large project that impacts society. It\u2019s tangible and will be in use for a long time to come.</p><h3><strong>Have there been any pivotal moments or choices made during your career that have impacted your success or progress?</strong></h3><p>The decision to enrol at university was the first pivotal choice I made in my career. It taught me the importance of trying out new things and not getting stuck in a position that is not making you happy. Since then I haven\u2019t looked back. I enjoyed my degree and the four years flew by.</p><p>Working as an engineer is a lot of fun, and in terms of progress I feel like I can constantly progress as each project I work on adds to my experience and value.</p><p>More recently I made another change in my career by leaving my role as an electrical engineer and taking a new role as a project manager with TransGrid. I now manage large engineering projects, which was my aspiration in the first place. This has been a great move for my career; I am now responsible for rolling out large engineering projects.</p><h3><strong>What has been your greatest achievement to date?</strong></h3><p>I am very proud of graduating as a mature age student and achieving First Class Honours and a University Medal. At the time, I was concerned that I may have struggled to keep up with the pace of the university courses which encouraged me to apply a strong work ethic to my studies.</p><p>I discovered that by studying something I am passionate about, I was able to learn and grow beyond what I had expected, and that the learning experience was fun and rewarding. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve this goal without the support of my friends and family, and the encouragement of my lecturers and fellow students.</p><h3><strong>Is there an innovation or change in the field of electrical engineering that has shifted the way things are done?</strong></h3><p>I work in the energy industry and at the moment there are a number of changes on the horizon that are really exciting and will definitely change the status quo.</p><p>Firstly, renewable energy and energy storage is disrupting traditional energy markets. This has been predicted for a number of years, and we are now approaching the point where it will become cost effective for households to install battery storage and solar panels. This will have a drastic effect on our energy markets, as traditional revenue streams are affected while the cost of providing energy to customers through traditional energy networks simultaneously increases due to the decrease in demand and the associated technical challenges that come with that.</p><p>Secondly, the way engineering design has traditionally been conducted and communicated to construction teams is through two-dimensional drawings. With modern processes it is becoming common to design in three-dimensions, which opens up new possibilities. Information can be gathered from laser scanning, which is then used to build three-dimensional models of existing spaces. New work can be designed in the three-dimensional models, which opens up opportunities for designers to be more creative and innovative, as well as providing more robust designs that have accurate clash detection and greater visibility of safety requirements. These changes are opening up new opportunities for young engineers and expanding their career options.</p><h3><strong>What advice would you give to a young person considering studying electrical engineering?</strong></h3><p>The exciting thing about engineering is that many possibilities will be available to you. In my experience, engineers typically work on projects that are unique. Many engineers who specialise in a particular field eventually branch out to work in new areas, or move on to senior management positions later in their careers.</p><p>Engineers are also highly sought after in other industries such as management consulting and finance. My advice is to engage with what you are doing, learn as much as you can from each subject and each lecturer, and keep an open mind for future opportunities. Once you finish studying, don\u2019t be scared to change your job or career and try new things!</p><h3><strong>What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in the field of electrical engineering in the next five years?</strong></h3><p>There will be a need for subject matter experts who can solve the technical challenges associated with renewable energy and energy storage integration into traditional power systems. I also believe there will be new market opportunities in the energy industry due to new technologies which will also provide new opportunities for start-up businesses in this space.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Working with Associate Professor Noel Young at Westmead Clinical School, a team of University of Sydney <a name=\"_Hlk499021987\"></a>biomedical engineering students have designed a rapid stroke prediction system using computer vision and AI to address this pressing need. It was the winning proposal at this year\u2019s MedTech Innovation Competition.</p><p>Hosted by the University of Sydney's Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, the annual MedTech Innovation Competition pairs fourth-year biomedical engineering students with industry-based supporters such as Westmead Hospital, Biointellect, CSIRO, Fledge and Corin Orthopaedics. Working under the guidance of Westmead clinicians, 20 student teams developed innovative solutions which included a non-invasive intracranial pressure monitor, a fall prevention gyro, osteoelastic bone blade system and dementia screening.</p><p>\u201cWe learned of the immediate need for a stroke predictive system that can provide accurate results within six hours of onset,\u201d says Joshua Riley, one of the winning team members.</p><p>The team\u2019s ViSP System uses computer vision and analysis combined with 4D CT perfusion scans and deep machine learning to predict the chances of stroke. By analysing a variety of factors including tissue density, blood volumetric flow and velocity analysis, the system will generate a risk factor for ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes which, when packaged into a detailed report for clinicians, may help determine the next steps in treatment.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe competition gave us a chance to put all the skills we\u2019ve learnt over the past three years into action and really showed us what a career in biomedical engineering is all about,\u201d says Christine Trinh, Engineering Honours (Biomedical) / Commerce student at the University of Sydney.</p><p>\u201cAll the projects undertaken for this competition have great potential to help millions of people, and with that, I\u2019m thankful to have had this exposure to potentially life-changing technology.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>MedTech Innovation Competition winning team members as pictured:\u00a0Shu Huang, Aeryne Lee, Michelle Yi Fan Lu, Feixue Ma, Joshua Riley, James Spinks and Christine Trinh.</p><p>[1] https://strokefoundation.org.au/About-Stroke/Facts-and-figures-about-stroke</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Don\u2019s design uses a single lens which means that a very compact camera with a single centre of projection can be built, keeping processing simple.</p><p>\u201cA key technology in making this happen is the monocentric lens, which uses concentric glass spheres to capture images over a huge field of view,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, these lenses could have a 360-degree field of view if we didn't need to install sensors to capture the light.\u201d</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div class=\"contentContainerMediaObjectModule\n\t\t\t \t\twidth-full\n\t\t\t \t\t\">\n\t\t\t<div><figure class=\"b-image\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/news-and-events/2017/building-the-best-camera-for-a-robot-don-dansereau-2.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg\" alt=\"Close-up of robotic camera\" class=\"b-image__image\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><p>A wide field-of-view is crucial in robotics as light field capture simplifies tasks where three-dimensional (3D) scene motion would normally complicate perception.</p><p>When combined, such a camera is ideal for close-up interaction with complex scenes where time and power supply are limited. Accordingly, drone landing, delivery robots, self-driving cars and other related kinds of autonomy are much easier with a wide FOV light field camera.</p><p>\u201cIn 10\u201315 years, it seems possible that more cameras will be manufactured for robots than for humans, and it makes a lot of sense to ask, \u2018what's the best camera for a robot\u2019?\u201d Don says.</p><p>\u201cI believe light field cameras and other computational imaging technologies will allow us to tailor cameras to specific robotics applications, allowing greater levels of autonomy and reliability even in challenging conditions.\u201d</p><p>And in the context of the debate over humans competing with robots for future jobs, Don offers a considered opinion.</p><p>\u201cIn 1870, 70-hour work weeks were the norm in the USA and Europe, and this has since fallen to between 35 and 40 hours. Over this period, many more new jobs have been created than old jobs lost, and I think it's possible this trend will continue,\u201d he suggests.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my hope that robotics and automation will continue to increase the efficiency with which we accomplish our goals, lowering the cost of living while decreasing human workload.\u201d</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Expiration dates may soon be past their shelf life</h2><p>Expiration dates serve as a quick method for determining whether food is safe to be consumed. While convenient, these labels are not accurate and rely on theoretical assumptions. Research engineer Long Nguyen, from the ARC Training Centre for the Australian Food Processing Industry, has developed a simple, inexpensive sensor in sticker form which changes colour in the presence of the ammonia released from spoiled foods such as red meat.</p><h2>2. Drones are a farmer's best friend</h2><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) may just be the answer to the ongoing bird problem plaguing the agriculture industry. PhD candidate Zihao Wang has proposed programing UAVs to chase the pests away on sight. His research suggests equipping each UAV with three crucial components: sensors to actively search for birds on the farm; a ground station translating sensor data into missions for the drones; and the drones themselves. This method intends to reduce the current annual loss of commercial crops suffered by farmers.</p><h2>3. Health benefits of virtual reality</h2><p>Immersive virtual reality and exergaming (games that support physical activity) technology is the perfect recipe to engage and motivate players in physical and cognitive activity. PhD candidate Kiran Ijaz's 'VR Rides' is one such example, comprising of a recumbent tricycle, real-world panoramic images and a virtual reality headset that allows the user to peddle their way around real locations in a safe, virtual environment.</p><h2>4. No more traffic jams</h2><p>Real-time traffic monitoring and remote car parking inspections are closer to being a reality courtesy of ongoing research by PhD candidate Zhe Yu. The telecommunications engineer is designing a reconfigurable Internet of Things communications platform for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to support Smart Campus applications and meet energy efficiency, data-rate and transmission range requirements. Real-time image processing algorithms will be developed for the UAV to perform detailed functions such as reading number plates, parking permits and assessing parking occupancy.</p><h2>5. Robots lend more than just a helping hand</h2><p>Developing a mobile robotics research platform with a controllable arm for safe user interaction is being explored by PhD student Anthony Tompkins.

You never quite know what you may be working on month-to-month, which keeps the work interesting. Such a dynamic also allows you to learn the newest technologies, which can then be incorporated into projects</p><h3>Has there been any pivotal moment or choice made during your career that has impacted your success or progress?</h3><p>My first role as a software engineer was with a startup company before I transitioned into consultancy with bigger organisations. It was after this initial shift that I realised what had been lost - the feeling of not being part of a family or the comradery with work colleagues.</p><h3>What has been your greatest achievement to date as a software engineer?</h3><p>I am fondly proud of the pro bono work I did in developing a medical database website for the International Diabetes Foundation. It was part of their 'Life for a Child' program aimed at minimising the risk of Type 1 diabetes in young people.</p><h3>Is there an innovation or change that has shifted how things operate in the field of software engineering?</h3><p>One thing that stands out is the emergence of cloud based computing. The orchestration of these systems allows an entire software stack, including all the hardware needed to be created, to be accessed at the touch of a button.</p><h3>What advice would you give to a young person considering studying software engineering?</h3><p>If you are interested in solving fascinating real world problems using a software-based approach and want to work in a career where you are forever learning something new, then software engineering is for you!</p><h3>What job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in the field of data security in the coming years?</h3><p>Data security is a booming area with more companies becoming conscious that they must take more precautionary measures to protect their confidential information, so as to not find themselves in the situation where a data breach occurs. I have no doubt that there will be plenty more opportunities in this field in the years to come as companies start to mitigate the risk for data exposure.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

I made some lifelong friends, collaborators and advisers from my time at Sydney Uni. I even met my wife at the university.</p><h3>Have there been any pivotal moments or choices made during your career that have impacted your success or progress? What did you learn from that experience?</h3><p>Two things come to mind. I was smitten by the automotive industry and desperate to work in Formula One racing. The automotive industry was on the decline and a job in F1 was even less likely. I took a job with a freight wagon manufacturing company in Newcastle after finishing my degree.</p><p>At the time, mining was the career in vogue and I remember being uninspired by the rail industry. It was antiquated, appeared technologically simple and the industry was saturated by old men in cardigans who spent their career in the industry. I eventually realised the opportunities that were being afforded to me by being part of a well-established industry that was about to evolve rapidly.</p><p>I got to go to some amazing sites around Australia and the world. I got to participate and actually witness the contribution the rail industry was making.\u00a0Eventually I learned to embrace my career in the rail industry and realise that hobby\u2019s and passions are separate from a career. Being part of the rail industry, whilst wasn\u2019t my initial preference has enabled me to enjoy my hobbies and interests as I wish.\u00a0This experience taught me the benefit of an open mind. Whist not all experiences in my\u00a0career have been positive, I now know what I do and don\u2019t like doing.</p><h3>What has been your greatest achievement to date \u2013 something that you are really proud of? What helped you to reach that goal?</h3><p>Not wanting to sound clich\u00e9, I would have to say starting my own engineering consultancy.</p><p>The day I cut the metaphorical bowlines to my previous, stable, regularly paid employment I was riddled with anxiety. I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be detrimental to my career, reputation or capabilities.\u00a0In fact, it has been the opposite for all those. I\u2019m really proud that we now employ multiple staff and have a positive standing in the industry in the relatively short period of time we have been operating.</p><p>Multiple factors have helped this goal flourish. I have a very capable and quality driven business partner whose personality and skills compliment mine.\u00a0I also have a very supportive and understanding wife, who was willing to make scarifies to ensure the success of this goal.</p><p>With regards to the people in my life, I\u2019ve been lucky and am very grateful.\u00a0The rest of it has come down to hard work.</p><h3>Is there an innovation or change in your field of expertise that has shifted the way things are done?</h3><p>It\u2019s more of an evolution than an innovation. Computing power and data storage is continually improving which helps answer more questions more quickly.\u00a0Also, I like the fact that safety is continuously improving and the respect for it is embraced more and more.</p><h3>What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in your field of expertise in the next 5 years?</h3><p>Various Australian governments are making significant investments in rail transport. Sydney is getting its first driverless automatic train in the next few years with the installation of the Sydney Metro. Light rail systems are popping up in various states. New trains mean new technologies and system that make the lives of the community more comfortable and safer.</p><p>Heavy haul mining companies are also investing in automatic driving technologies to enhance the throughput of their commodity and make the networks safer. My initial impression of the rail industry being antiquated is no longer as defence based and aerospace technologies continue to emerge throughout the industry.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

AM also has been used to produce prototype parts with desired properties for evaluation and testing, as well as to manufacture small or medium quantities of end-use products.</p><p>However, from the birth of AM technology up to now, trustworthiness and durability of AM parts is still not completely reliable. Specifically, mechanical properties of these AM parts are slightly different from those manufactured via traditional methods.</p><p>It is therefore a big challenge for industries to trust AM technology for critical components and structures in aerospace, automotive, and biomedical.</p><p>This is where Hoda Eskandari hopes her research as part of her <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/pr/doctor-of-philosophy-engineering-and-it.html\">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</a> can make a difference.</p><p>\u201cThe ultimate goal of my research is to improve mechanical properties involved with Additive Manufacturing (AM), specifically fatigue performance by eliminating induced defects mostly by applying post processing,\u201d Hoda said.</p><p>\u201cBriefly, my project is focused on a Stainless Steel (SS) manufactured by Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS). Mechanical behaviour of this material is compared to standard stainless steel in order to improve the 3D printed parts in terms of quality and performance.</p><p>\u201cBy improving the properties of such AM parts, this technology could apply in sectors such as aerospace, where for airlines the advantages are substantial, including finding spare parts quickly and of course lighter and stronger parts, resulting in massive weight and cost savings.\u201d</p><p>Hoda\u2019s research underscores the need to spread this technology particularly in Australia as the AM market is on the rise globally.</p><p>\u201cThe key to the successful implementation of AM into the real world is to have a good understanding of the technology, which is possible by collaborating of research and development part and industries,\u201d Hoda added.</p><p>\u201cBy following the growth of this technology, AM is likely to become inseparable part of human life in the early future and probably, 3D printing shops will pop-up in different places to help people to access them any time they need in a short leading time with trustworthy quality.</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly the next generation of this technology is 4D printing which looks to create structures that changes shapes at a later time when interacting with the new conditions.\u201d</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Ian believes there\u2019s a huge opportunity for this technology in other industries, including emergency services and insurance, as well as its current applications in agriculture.</p><p>\u201cNinety seven percent of commercial UAVs are multirotor aircraft; the greatest limitation of these aircraft is their speed and endurance, and hence range,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOnly 3% of commercial UAVs are fixed-wing (aeroplanes). Aeroplanes have the disadvantage of not being able to hover, and the advantage of much greater range. But this statistic highlights another limitation: current regulations make it very difficult to legally fly a UAV \u2018beyond visual line-of-sight\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a tech startup where you need to demonstrate technological feasibility, it\u2019s extremely helpful to have the technical skills to build a functioning prototype yourself. Otherwise, you need to find a technical co-founder or pay for the development out of your own pocket, which can be particularly expensive for a hardware startup.\u201d</p><p>Ian adds that his tertiary background in mechanical engineering gave him the foundation upon which to build his career.</p><p>\u201cIt gave me skills for developing almost every part of the prototype myself,\u201d he asserts.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

While he initially considered engineering upon leaving high school, the creative industries won him over. After completing a media studies degree, Alastair went on to win awards in Australia and internationally for short films he shot and co-produced, including one which was shown at the Cannes International Film Festival.</p><p>However, after witnessing first-hand the disruption of content industries by tech startups and finding that he enjoyed designing and building camera rigs and trick optical devices as much as using them, Alastair decided that it was time to get back on the side of the disruptors. After a 12-year hiatus, he returned to tertiary study by enrolling in the Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Mechanical) at the University of Sydney.</p><p>Alastair was admitted into the Advanced Engineering stream and developed an app as part of his honours thesis to help engineering students visualise numerical methods \u2013 an approach later incorporated into a unit of study with\u00a0Dr <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/nicholas.williamson.php\">Nicholas Williamson</a>. On the Dean's list from 2014\u201316, Alastair received the University Medal in 2016, along with other faculty prizes and awards.</p><h3>What are you currently working on?</h3><p>I recently completed a stint at a startup called Tzukuri, which makes high-end smart eyeglasses. They contain a chip that talks to your phone, to let you know where your glasses are if you misplace them. Currently I'm working on a couple of very early stage products. One is a humidifier mask for frequent flyers, using 3D facial scanning, geometric clustering and rapid prototyping techniques to ensure a comfortable fit. The other is a self-contained continuum robot kit that snaps together like a jigsaw. Continuum robots are like tentacles or caterpillars \u2013 quite unlike the typical robot form that you might imagine.</p><h3>What's most enjoyable about working in the startup space?</h3><p>There\u2019s usually lots of flexibility to define your own role. You really need to be creative in how you leverage your engineering mindset to solve problems, and often do so outside of core engineering areas. I've designed and built jigs and work holding devices, production tracking systems, mass finishing systems, adhesives and frame trimming machines. But I've also been involved in implementing lean management and communications systems, working out how to fabricate product displays for company events, brainstorming marketing concepts, and even writing and proofing website content. The variety and pace of the work is pretty invigorating.</p><h3>What career opportunities are out there for a mechanical engineer?</h3><p>I've got graduate friends working in consulting, finance, big data analysis, med-tech, automation and sub-sea exploration, as well as more traditional mechanical areas like rail and of course in startups. I think we're more in need than ever of graduates who have the ability to form an accurate mental model of the world, and I think a wide range of employers see that value in engineering graduates.</p><h3>How are the mechanical engineering skills you learned at university applied in the real world?</h3><p>Sometimes what you learn can feel a bit abstract. But just this week I had to manipulate a 3D printer to truly print on three axes (rather than along horizontal slices) and ended up using more vector algebra than I ever thought I would. This is not an isolated example; how you use what you learn really<i> </i>is only limited by your creativity.</p><p>I've probably found the skills I learnt in the Advanced Engineering program the most professionally applicable, such as communication, project- and time-management, and formulating actionable approaches to complex, open-ended problems.</p><h3>What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in your field of expertise in the next 5 years?</h3><p>The mass-market availability of brain\u2013computer interfaces may bring mind-controlled systems and robots out of the realms of med-tech and prosthetics and into the world of wearables and consumer goods. I find that pretty exciting; what engineer doesn't want to build thought-controlled robots?</p><p>Essentially, if you've ever pulled anything apart to see how it works, you should definitely consider a career in mechanical engineering \u2013 especially if you got it back together without losing too many screws!</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

His work focuses on how the mechanics and physics of granular (and porous) materials can affect the efficiency and reliability of renewable energy systems, such as solar thermal storage and battery systems.</p><p>\u201cWe are living in a time of transition from fossil-based to sustainable energy sources. My research aims to improve our fundamental understanding of the transport phenomena - including transport of electrons, heat and ionic species - to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of energy systems, and reduce their risk of failure. The research impact will also extend to national policy on renewable and sustainable energy resources, by providing government with credible information regarding feasibility and risk analyses,\u201d says Dr Gan.</p><p>Last year Dr Gan received a <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/our-researchers/sydney-research-accelerator-prizes.html\">SOAR fellowship</a> as part of a funding scheme by the University of Sydney established to help researchers reach their full potential and have a lasting impact with in their respective fields.</p><p>\u201cThe support of the SOAR fellowship offers unique opportunities to enhance my research profile and allow an acceleration of my current research plans. In addition, the fellowship allows us to further develop synergies between the research outcomes and fast growing industries in energy storage systems through patent development and commercialisation,\u201d says Dr Gan.</p><p>One of Dr Gan\u2019s areas of specialisation is <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/science/physics/research/fusion/overview.shtml\">nuclear fusion</a>, a reaction that produces extreme amounts of energy from the collision of subatomic particles. For years researchers have explored ways in which nuclear fusion can be harnessed as a viable source of renewable energy. However, safe and reliable nuclear fusion has proven tremendously difficult to achieve. Dr Gan is part of the global effort to develop solutions in this complex field, providing his expertise in granular materials to leading researchers across France, Germany, India, USA and China.</p><p>With the help of SOAR funding, Dr Gan will further contribute to nuclear fusion research, by leading the international organising team for the second <a href=\"http://sydneyuniversity.cn/event/second-international-workshop-on-mechanics-of-energy-materials-iwmem-for-2017/\">International Workshop on Mechanics of Energy Materials</a> which will be held in the <a href=\"http://sydneyuniversity.cn/\">Sydney Centre</a> in Suzhou, China.

Hydrocarbon gases then rise into a distillery column, leaving behind petroleum coke, or \u2018petcoke\u2019. Petcoke is burned to recover reusable compounds, however, this harmful by-product actually emits 11% more greenhouse gases than coal [1].</p><p>\u201cAlmost a quarter of the feedstocks used in the refinement process become undesired by-products or wastes\u201d, says Associate Professor Huang, who has a solution that could shift the hydrocarbon industry towards a more sustainable future.</p><p>\u201cTo speed up the refinement process, we currently use chemical \u2018catalysts\u2019 such as zeolites and silica-alumina, where we\u2019ve designed new and unique catalysts based on penta-coordinated aluminium.</p><p>\u201cThese catalysts are high in acidity, which allows us to reduce the amount petcoke left behind in hydrocarbon production. As a result, our catalysts decrease carbon dioxide emissions from oil refinement by 28%,\u201d says Associate Professor Huang.</p><p>The implications of this research are highly significant for the hydrocarbon industry and highlight the potential for a \u2018catalyst industry\u2019 in Australia.</p><p>\u201cDenmark for example, has created an entire industry exporting ammonia to hydrocarbon manufacturers across the globe. Our catalysts, developed in Australia, provide a more cost-effective and sustainable solution that is in high demand,\u201d says Associate Professor Huang.</p><p>The combustion of hydrocarbon fuels still emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, creating the need for alternative energy sources in the future.

This was such a unique experience; entire subjects were devoted to helping organisations find solutions to the real problems they were facing.<br>\n<br>\nFrequently, the deliverables from these subjects were presented to very senior audiences; to get that kind of exposure at such an early stage of your career development is incredible.</p><h3>What do you enjoy most about your current role at Westpac Group?</h3><p>I have a passion for working and collaborating with others and at Westpac Group, I\u2019m very lucky to be in a heavily cooperative and innovative team. Over the past 200 years the company has fostered a fantastic culture that supports both professional and personal development, and experiencing this has been a real highlight.<br>\n<br>\nOne of the standout points of the project management degree is how it helps you understand what it\u2019s like to lead and work in a team environment. This skillset has really helped with aligning myself to a completely new industry and company.</p><h3>What has been the most pivotal moment or choice made during your career to date?</h3><p>Transitioning from the engineering sector to the financial sector was a big career move for me and it involved undertaking further study.</p><p>I was enjoying my time with SMEC Australia, helping to provide project management support and deliver insights to clients, but I knew I wanted to explore opportunities in other industries.</p><p>To help me understand which area I wanted to focus my career on, I decided to continue my development by studying a Master of Management \u2013 again at the University of Sydney.</p><p>My postgraduate studies reaffirmed my interest in strategy, innovation and business transformation and late last year I was fortunate enough to join the Westpac Group and have an opportunity to be more involved in this space.</p><h3>What advice would you give to a young person considering studying project management?</h3><p>Immerse yourself in the learning opportunities provided to you both in and outside the classroom.</p><p>Any opportunities that involve presentations by industry professionals are so valuable and should not be missed. They are more than happy to pass on their knowledge to you and answer whatever questions you have about becoming a project manager or project specialist.</p><h3>How do you see the role and importance of project manager grow over the coming years?</h3><p>There are significant changes now happening around how project managers are perceived and classified in a number of industries. Businesses are placing greater trust in young project professionals who are technically trained in project management by giving them significant responsibilities. This change is really helping to accelerate the careers and development of younger project managers, which is great to see.</p><p>Traditionally, project management roles were reserved for team members who worked their way up to senior positions, but in today\u2019s market project management is being recognised as a technical skill. This is helping to create more employment and progression opportunities for graduating project management students.</p><p>I also strongly believe that younger project managers are bringing innovation and enthusiasm to their roles which is helping shape the future of what project management is and providing companies with great immediate benefits.</p><h3>Any final thoughts you would like to share to aspiring project managers?</h3><p>I highly recommend the Bachelor of Project Management at the University of Sydney to anyone interested in tertiary studies. The degree really is a fantastic mix of technical skills and soft skills that will set you apart in the business world. One of the best things about this degree is the transferability of the skillset you will acquire.<br>\n<br>\nProject management is highly regarded by all kinds of employers and industries and this really enhances the number of career opportunities available to students upon the completion of their studies.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

However, Bala has identified that citrus extract can have a very strong \u2018cytostatic effect\u2019, meaning they can prevent these cells from multiplying,\u201d says Dr Valtchev, a postdoctoral fellow from the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering who is supervising Bala\u2019s work.</p><p>Eager do something meaningful and inspiring, Bala brought his idea to Professor <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/fariba-dehghani.html\">Fariba Dehghani</a>, one the school\u2019s internationally-renowned researchers. Before long, Bala was quitting his job in pharmaceutical testing in Malaysia and moving to Australia to begin his journey as a PhD student at the University of Sydney.</p><p>So why focus on orange peels? The healthy benefits of citrus extract can be attributed to the bioactive compounds found in citrus fruits. These compounds are most concentrated in the fruit\u2019s peel, which often goes to waste. According to the <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/citrus.pdf\">United States Department of Agriculture</a>, oranges are the most consumed citrus fruit with 470,000 tonnes of oranges being harvested in the Australia in 2016/17.

Ultimately we want to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable this behaviour. The hope is to eventually create a supplement for people's diet that could act as a chemopreventive agent. It could even be used after chemotherapy to prevent a relapse in cancer growth,\u201d says Dr <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/peter-valtchev.html\">Peter Valtchev</a>.</p><p>Industry partner Defugo, a company with a patented technologies provide the capability to recover and enrich the active compounds required for Bala\u2019s research.</p><p>\u201cThe product under test is a commercial product produced in an existing factory; this is a very exciting project for our company<em>,\u201d</em>says Tim Lang, Chief Technical Officer at Defugo.</p><p>While the screening process shows intriguing results, Dr Valtchev reminds us that the positive effects are occurring in a controlled environment where the cancer cells are in constant contact with the bioactive compounds. While the biomolecular theory is there, it is difficult to predict how these compounds will behave in the human body.</p><p>Bala is hoping to complete his PhD early next year and has learned to be patient when he doesn\u2019t get the laboratory results he wants. \u201cPhD life is demanding, both mentally and physically, but it is really an interesting journey and worth the experience. I love the challenge and the work. It keeps motivated to come into the lab at 8am to do more tests and get more results. It\u2019s an exercise in resilience to stop and think about why the test is failing. But just small changes in the process and experiment design can cause a huge difference in the results,\u201d says Bala.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

He will be missed by all of us in the faculty and the University of Sydney.</p><p>Professor Prince was born in Chemnitz, Germany in 1928. He moved to Italy in 1936 with his mother and sister when the family split up. In 1938 they moved to England and then New Zealand, where he was educated at Christchurch Boys High School. He then studied chemical engineering and chemistry at Canterbury University College, graduating in 1949.</p><p>While Professor Prince's career spanned the globe, he always returned to the University of Sydney. He first came to the University in 1950 as a lecturer in chemical engineering. A few years later, he travelled to the UK to work for a distiller as a process engineer in their Research and Development Department in Epsom, Surrey. He also lectured at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch and the University of Queensland, Brisbane. In 1969 he returned to the University of Sydney, this time as aprofessor and Head of Department.</p><p>The two main fields that distinguished Professor Prince's influential 65-year career are distillation column design and computer simulation of chemical processes \u2013 the latter at a time when the University's only computer filled a room, required its own air-conditioning system and took an entire weekend to solve a single problem.</p><p>His contribution to our student's learning experience was significant and continues to resonate throughout the curriculum today. With an understanding of the importance of experiential learning through industry, Professor Prince pioneered the University's industrial experience program, laying the foundation for today's MIPPS scheme.</p><p>Professor Prince established a practice lab for first-year students. At the time female students seemed reluctant to pursue chemical engineering, thinking that their male counterparts had the advantage of growing up with more hands-on experience. In the new lab, students could see that everyone faced the same challenges, regardless of gender. Professor Prince's first-year labs not only gave more confidence to students in their early years, but also played a large role in encouraging gender diversity in the chemical engineering discipline.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Chief Executive Officer, Dr Nasir Ahsan \u2013 an alumnus of the <a href=\"http://www.acfr.usyd.edu.au/\">Australian Centre for Field Robotics</a> (ACFR) \u2013 has a passion for deep water exploration after spending time on board the Nautilus EV (with Bob Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic) exploring the depths of the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Ahsan and Masood Naqshbandi [BE(Civil/Structural), BComm], whose university research was in photonics, material chemistry and optical sensor technology, started Abyss Solutions with the vision of developing novel sensors to allow greater perception underwater and enable research and exploration in the deepest part of our oceans.</p><p>They were joined by Abraham Kazzaz, a civil and structural engineer with vast experience working on the design, construction management and condition assessment of high-rise residential and commercial structures, industrial buildings, telecommunications structures, railway infrastructure and water infrastructure.</p><p>The team saw a large gap in the market for asset inspection and management of civil and marine infrastructure such as dams, reservoirs, ships, ports and offshore structures.</p><p>\u201cWhile very expensive inspection or surveying equipment exists for deep offshore assessments, nothing of this nature is available to civil infrastructure companies, whose budgets don\u2019t afford such expensive equipment,\u201d says Naqshbandi. \u201cWe are implementing a lot of fresh research ideas to commercial problems to make this possible.\u201d</p><p>Abyss has worked on some highly challenging inspection projects where the conditions, location and size of the operations have lent themselves to Abyss\u2019 specialist technology. The inspection of the 34km Alexandra canal for Sydney Water, for example, was only achievable using Abyss\u2019 remote surface vessels, given the canal was completely inaccessible by land, air and water.</p><p>\u201cIn the canal, we collected over half a million images,\u201d remarks Naqshbandi. \u201cOur algorithms were able to process that within five hours, compared to 72 man hours and with 97% accuracy.\u201d</p><p>The inspection of 230 metre-long propellers on the Australian Navy ship, HMAS Adelaide, has also been made possible using the Abyss\u2019 underwater assets.</p><p>The Abyss team has high aspirations for the future. \u201cAbyss\u2019 aim is to be the most reputable asset management company in the world. We want to dominate markets in water, shipping and offshore,\u201d says Naqshbandi. \u201cIn the longer term, we want to create collaborative swarms of underwater robots that can build complex infrastructure underwater and image and survey the entire ocean floor.\u201d</p><p>Where is the robotics industry heading in coming years? Naqshbandi agrees with others in predicting the dominance of robotics and AI in industry, not only in terms of robots taking over mindless manual factory jobs but the use of AI to make menial and repetitive office work obsolete.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFor most people that is scary proposition and they are worried about losing their jobs, but I think it is a good thing,\u201d says Naqshbandi. \u201cNot only will it free up humans to pursue more creative and gratifying careers and hobbies, it will also make dangerous and dirty jobs safer and cleaner. Take Abyss for example, no diver wants to dive into toxic waters to inspect a wall, but the robots have no complaints doing that.\u201d</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

To date they are the only robotics company to create a directable sensor system with these features. Their RobotEye technology can improve the operational performance and efficiency for systems that rely on sensors. This includes robotics and automation, security and surveillance, aerospace and defence, mining and resources, and precision agriculture.</p><p>We might see Ocular Robotics\u2019 technology used by an airport for surveillance. If a bag, for example, is left in the airport the RobotEye camera can follow both the dropped bag and the person who left it, because of the camera\u2019s ability to move at lightning speed and track both objects as they move.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.qinetiq.com/\">QinetiQ</a>, a global defence and security business recently released their drone protection systems at the 2017 Paris Airshow; it\u2019s a system which incorporates an Ocular Robotics thermal camera system designed to identify and track multiple drones that may pose a threat to airports, critical infrastructure and public buildings.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div class=\"contentContainerMediaObjectModule\n\t\t\t \t\tleft width-medium\n\t\t\t \t\t\">\n\t\t\t<div><figure class=\"b-image\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/news-and-events/ocular-robotics-roboteye.png/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.png\" alt=\"Ocular Robotics' RobotEye \" class=\"b-image__image\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t<figcaption class=\"b-image__caption\">\n\t\t<p>Ocular Robotics' RobotEye technology improves operational performance and efficiency of systems using sensors</p>\n\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><p>An interesting project which involved Ocular Robotics\u2019 products was the scanning and digital mapping of the Priscilla Catacombs archeological site in Rome. Using an agile robot the team was able to explore all parts of the site, scan and interpret the vision and depth data to map out the site.</p><p>Ocular Robotics\u2019 CEO, Mark Bishop saw the potential for his company while working on a research project with the University\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html\">Australian Centre for Field Robotics</a>. One issue in the project centred on robot perception and the need to develop new ways to allow robots to interact more intelligently with their environment. For example, an automated mining truck might not be able to identify the difference between a tuft of grass on the ground and a rock and would drive around the grass unnecessarily. Mark developed the technology to allow multiple sensors to point in the same direction at the same time, enabling robots to make smarter decisions by applying a level of reasoning across the data available from the sensors.</p><p>\u201cOriginally my aim was to create a robotic solution for delivering timely and precise information to robotic platforms about their environment; however it soon became obvious that many applications across many sectors would benefit from the simultaneous, rapid and precise directing of sensors enabled by the RobotEye technology platform,\u201d said Mark.</p><p>Ocular Robotics\u2019 technology differs to others in that they\u2019ve removed most of the mass that normally needs to be moved to direct the view of the sensor. In other technologies changing the direction of view of a sensor would require you to move the sensor, one of the motors and their supporting structure, which are heavy and therefore reduces precision. Amazingly, the RobotEye is several times faster than the fastest saccadic movements of the human eye.</p><p>So what\u2019s the future of Ocular Robotics in Mark\u2019s eyes? \u201cWe will continue to innovate in the core RobotEye technology and the products we build around the technology, to bring unique capabilities to a range of sectors and applications.</p><p>\u201cI see some strong parallels between Ocular and other Australian companies like Cochlear and ResMed, who have been able to continue to innovate around a core capability over a long period of time, remaining market leaders in their sectors while building significant businesses on a global scale. I hope that Ocular will be able to emulate the success of companies like this in its own markets.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s an interesting time for engineers like Mark working in robotics, with technological developments charging forward and the demand for these innovations at a scale never seen before. In this new world of robotics and hyper-automation there\u2019s an ever-growing demand for\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/study/undergraduate-courses/mechatronic-engineering.html\">mechatronic engineering</a>\u00a0experts to lead the charge.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

The significance of the work was clear early on, when an apple grower discovered a surprising variation in the crop yield due to data gathered by ACFR. The grower immediately took action and changed his planting strategy to address the variation.</p><p>Applying robotics to agriculture not only offers benefits while the fruit is fully grown, but analysis can also be undertaken much earlier on during the flowering season, allowing the farmer to pre-sell produce based on a yield forecast.</p><p>While Suchet was completing his PhD, which he submitted in February, he started working with <a href=\"http://abysssolutions.co/\">Abyss Solutions</a>, a robotics company that combines Remotely Operated underwater Vehicles (ROVs) with data analytics to provide a safer, easier and more accurate means to inspect and assess underwater environments like dams, ships or ports.</p><p>Last year, the Abyss team worked on a project with Sydney Water to map the Alexandra canal in Sydney. They used an unmanned boat to collect image data along the river which enabled Sydney Water to identify the specific damages along the canal, rather than having to fix the entire canal. \u00a0</p><p>Suchet is now working full-time for Abyss as their Chief Technology Officer and is delighted to have the opportunity. \u201cAbyss is a fun, exciting and fast paced place to work at; I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing out of my PhD I wanted to keep working with technology, while also developing high-level skills like strategy and business development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited about where the future is heading in the world of robotics and machine learning to transform what was previously manual work into clever automated systems,\u201d he said.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [{"href": ["https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html"], "category": "Centres and institutes_", "title": "Australian Centre for Field Robotics", "summary": "We focus on the research, development and application of autonomous and intelligent robots, and systems for use in outdoor environments."}], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Today, this venture is a thriving global business that spans five countries.</p><p>Eight years on, Ruchir plays a pivotal role in supporting\u00a0the leaders of Langoor and its group of companies.\u00a0These companies include leading brands such as AlterNet in the Internet of Things world; Pensaar, a leading Design Thinking business; and Kreate Konnect, an e-commerce channel advisory business.</p><p>Ruchir is also passionate about making a positive impact on people\u2019s lives. He created the Australia India Youth Dialogue, a diplomatic dialogue between the young leaders of Australia and India.\u00a0He serves as Director on a number of not-for-profit and business boards \u2013 the kind of service that Ruchir got a taste for this at the University of Sydney where he was on the Board of International House and President of the University of Sydney Union.</p><p>Currently, he is focusing on expanding the Langoor Group as well as setting up a few ventures with a social agenda. One such venture is creating a Graduate School of Policy and Governance in India for the developing world. We asked Ruchir about his success to date and his plans for the future.</p><h3>What do you enjoy most about your current role?</h3><p>I\u2019m working across a range of organisations and projects right now besides my primary role as Chairperson of Langoor. I like the diversity of work and the ability to go in and out of respective pieces of work as required.</p><h3>What has been your greatest achievement to date \u2013 something that you are really proud of? What helped you to reach that goal?</h3><p>To be honest, I am not quite satisfied with what I have done so far. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t regret anything and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of being involved with some wonderful things, but I continue to want to learn and push the boundaries on how I can improve the human race and move it forward. At 30, I feel there is a lot to be done.</p><h3>Where do you see the digital marketing industry headed over the next five years?</h3><p>I think there are going to be a range of speciality areas in digital marketing including augmented reality, virtual reality, data and analytics, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence as well as applications for non-conventional screens. These are all exciting areas and will offer some amazing opportunities for engineers and IT professionals to get involved with. People who can connect the dots and pull together a range of these areas will be in high demand.</p><h3>How does your company differ from its competitors?</h3><p>Langoor is a digital agency of 200+ creative technologists.\u00a0These days a lot of our competitors are specialists in the services they offer. However, for the brands we work with, we believe the real edge comes from balancing insight, data, creativity and technology with experience. This means understanding their business goals and helping them achieve those holistically. That\u2019s not easy to do with multiple specialists and this is what helps us to stand out.</p><p>With operations across Asia Pacific, we also appeal to organisations that want to reach these diverse markets. There are not many companies that have the perspective and experience that we do across this region.</p><p>Lastly, we have a setup where we leverage skills and learnings across borders. We end up with an inherent competitive advantage because of how we can apply our learnings from different markets.</p><h3>Can you describe an average day for you?</h3><p>I'm actually a Non-Executive Chair in Langoor. This means my time in Langoor usually goes in solving problems that directly support the CEO including strategy, fundraising, PR and some new business development. This is in addition to supporting the respective leaders of AlterNet, Kreate Konnect and Pensaar.</p><p>Personally, I am also working on a School of Policy and Governance (an institution) we are building in India to reimagine public policy education from a developing world perspective.</p><p>I've invested in a few other start-ups. My favourite of these is one which we\u2019re building to be a publisher in the not-for-profit space in India.\u00a0</p><p>Given the range of my interests, there is no real structure to the day per se. Often it\u2019s also in different cities and so the intensity of the day can differ depending on where I am.</p><h3>Your new start-up, AlterNet is at the forefront in one of the latest emerging industries. How would you describe the Internet of Things and how do you see it being utilised by businesses in the future?</h3><p>\u2018Internet of Things\u2019 (IoT) is more a buzz phrase than it is real. It is an umbrella phrase that promises a new world, but in some ways is limiting the imagination of what is possible because of how broad the idea is.\u00a0</p><p>What is more real is building sensors to help building managers control temperature, virtual reality games and health trackers like FitBit etc; the point I am trying to make is IoT as a term is too generic but there is some amazing innovation happening at the intersection of different areas through the connection of hardware to the Internet.\u00a0</p><p>Organisations are going to have to work out what they are good at and whether there are technologies they can take from other areas to help them improve. While the \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 is so broad, innovation in their particular field of expertise using hardware and the Internet can be game changing.</p><p>As people and organisations continue to innovate, we are going to witness a complete reimagining of the business landscape in less than 10 years. Business models that have existed for the last 100 years are not going to exist in the next 10 through the adoption of practical IoT and Artificial Intelligence.\u00a0</p><h3>Langoor is now a global business spanning Hong Kong, Singapore, India and Dubai. Have there been any differences in the way Langoor operates in each country?</h3><p>It is quite amazing how markets react to the same technology. For example, a lack of vernacular language keyboards on phones in India has meant that many people use the WhatsApp voice messages and voice call functions. However, in Australia, most of that usage is through typing. In many parts of the Middle East, WhatsApp calling is banned.</p><p>Similarly, most Indians experienced the internet for the first time on their mobile, skipping the whole desktop experience and so they use the internet more for utility (commodity prices, messaging, etc.) than for entertainment.</p><p>There are many examples like these where different tools and technologies have received a stronger response in some markets in which we operate compared to others.</p><h3>What\u2019s next for Langoor?</h3><p>As a business, we are looking to strengthen our presence in the region and consolidate our work with lesser, yet bigger clients.\u00a0</p><p>We will also go very deep this year on leveraging data meaningfully.</p><p>Lastly, we are keen on expanding our footprint either in the UK or the USA. Many of the decisions impacting our region are made by their organisation's headquarters in these countries.</p><h3>Have there been pivotal moments or choices made in your career that impacted your success? What did you learn from that experience?</h3><p>I think starting Langoor right out of university happened because I was at the right place at the right time. I was quite na\u00efve, to say the least, when I started out but there is no education equivalent to running your own business. Seven years along and I am less active in that business, but because of that experience, I am now quite confident walking into new areas I know nothing about.</p><h3>As a student, you were passionate about social change. Does this passion still resonate throughout your current projects?</h3><p>Frankly, I have reduced the time I spend in Langoor partly because I am still deeply passionate about social change. There are a limited number of things I can do in Langoor that help me make a meaningful difference in the world.\u00a0</p><p>At the moment, the School of Policy and Governance, as well as the publishing platform for Indian not-for-profits, are the two key items that have me immensely engaged in helping move humanity forward.</p><p>Importantly I believe that you can use capitalism to your advantage, and eventually, redistribute wealth to reduce inequality in the world. At 30, I am still working on building my wealth to hopefully one day have the privilege to affect humanity in a positive way.\u00a0</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

While he was there the Martin Jetpack was featured in Time Magazine as one of the 50 Best Inventions of 2010.</p><p>Realising his desire to further explore the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) he moved back to Australia and completed his PhD at Sydney University with the <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html\">Australian Centre for Field Robotics</a>.</p><p>During his four years of research he demonstrated what is thought to be the world\u2019s first autonomous mid-air docking between two UAVs, also known as drones. As a result of this breakthrough, in 2016 he was named one of Engineers Australia's Top 50 Innovators in Australia.</p><p>Last year he relocated to San Francisco where he is the Co-Founder/CEO of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/6481015/\">OCI\u00a0Technologies</a>, an aerospace company focused on developed autonomous solutions that extend the capability of unmanned aircraft.</p><p>We spoke to Daniel about where his passion for developing UAVs came from and where he sees the aerospace industry heading in the future.</p><h3>What do you love most about working at OCI\u00a0Technologies?</h3><p>The thing I enjoy most about my job is being lucky enough to spend most of my time doing what I love.</p><h3>What has been a pivotal moment during your career that got you to where you are today?</h3><p>An important moment was during my mechatronic undergraduate degree at Sydney University when I decided to build a low-cost autopilot UAV (drone) as my final year thesis with Dr Ali Haydar G\u00f6kto\u011fan as my supervisor. It was my first taste of UAVs and has shaped my entire career. Dr G\u00f6kto\u011fan also later became my PhD supervisor which was fantastic.</p><h3>What has been your greatest achievement so far?</h3><p>One of the highlights of my career was being selected by Engineers Australia as one of Australia\u2019s Top 50 Innovators last year. It was the culmination of four years of postgraduate research, so it was great to recognised for all the hard work. My experience at Sydney University helped me reach that goal and they also nominated me for the award!</p><h3>Can you tell us a bit about your current work at OCI\u00a0Technologies?</h3><p>We\u2019ve been lucky enough to be involved in some of the most cutting-edge aerospace projects, working primarily on autonomous airborne navigation systems.</p><h3>Has there been a change in your field that has shifted the way things are done?</h3><p>There have been some gradual regulatory changes around UAV operations. These rules mostly affect commercial operators but it has impeded UAV research in the past, particularly in the USA.</p><p>Previously US regulations made outdoor UAV testing very difficult. It could only occur in a handful of designated areas by certified operators. The UAV would otherwise have to be tethered or be flying in a netted area.</p><h3>What exciting job opportunities are on the horizon in the world of aerospace?</h3><p>In the next five years I think we will see passenger-carrying autonomous electric aircraft deployed for relatively short journeys. With that we will see opportunities to design the vehicles and infrastructure.</p><h3>What are the next steps for you at OCI\u00a0Technologies?</h3><p>We will continue to seek out and work on interesting aerospace projects while simultaneously building our own product offering.</p><p>In five years I\u2019d like to see the team expanded, the company sustained through our product line and a large portion of the engineering team focused on cutting-edge aerospace research.\u00a0</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [{"href": ["http://www.acfr.usyd.edu.au/"], "category": "Centres and institutes_", "title": "Australian Centre for Field Robotics", "summary": "We are one of the largest robotics research institutes in the world and has been instrumental in developing breakthrough technologies and in conducting world-leading research and development of field robotics principles and systems."}], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Directors, Ray Biffin and Hubert Regtop were concerned about the use of menadione, a synthetic Vitamin K supplement known as K3, which is toxic to humans but used in the feed for chickens, pigs and horses, as well as pet foods.</p><p>\"Vitamin K3, we have shown, substantially decreases chicken bone density, and creates both animal welfare and commercial productivity issues\", says Mr Regtop, Research Director at Agricure.</p><p>To tackle the problem, Agricure is working with researchers in the University's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering to develop chicken feed and other animal feeds fortified with natural Vitamin K1. Vitamin K1 phylloquinone occurs naturally in high concentrations in green vegetables, algae and grasses but is unstable when subjected to UV light.</p><p>In high intensive poultry farming there is little natural K1 intake, particularly in battery chickens which are not able to range freely eating grass and insects. Similarly, horses fed a high-energy starch diet rather than allowed to quietly graze in paddocks, have been found to suffer bone density issues as they grow.</p><p>Andrea Talbot, a PhD student in the School's ARC Food Processing Training Centre (ARCFPTC), has shown that replacing the synthetic menadione with natural Vitamin K1 makes chickens healthier and more profitable by increasing bone density, overall lifetime and egg-laying productivity. The research has enabled Agricure to secure the international patent for the stable form of Vitamin K which can be added to feed.</p><p>\"We believe that this is a simple first step toward getting K1 back into the food chain,\" says Andrea, who is working for Agricure while completing her doctorate.</p><p>\"Being in partnership with the ARC Food Processing Group, and the University of Sydney generally, provides Agricure with international exposure and lends academic rigor to its own research and development. The partnership has allowed Agricure to access equipment and expertise that we may lack here at the factory.\"</p><p>Research team member, Tom Tarento is also developing low-cost Vitamin K1 products from microalgae and cyanobacteria \u2013 the ancient ancestors of land plants. Not only will these products be super-rich in Vitamin K1, they will contain a host of other beneficial nutrients and bioactive compounds for both human and animal health.</p><p>From a consumer perspective, eggs and chickens enriched with K1 will be beneficial to increase our Vitamin K intake, being more readily absorbed and stable compared to other dietary sources. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble Vitamin that is best known for the important role it plays in blood clotting.</p><p>However, Vitamin K is also absolutely essential to building strong bones, preventing heart disease, and crucial parts of other bodily processes. While we know less about the role of Vitamin K in human bone health than calcium and Vitamin D, research confirms that a Vitamin K deficiency can lead to weaker bones and an increased risk of fractures.</p><p>More than 4.74 million Australians over the age of 50 have osteoporosis or poor bone health. By 2022 it's predicted that there will be one fracture every 2.9 minutes. Over the next 10 years, the total cost of osteoporosis and associated fractures is estimated to be $33.6 billion.<sup>1</sup></p><p>In addition to answering Agricure's brief for improving animal welfare and productivity, the Chemical and Biomolecular engineering research team is also in the process of developing low-cost Vitamin K-added products for human consumption.</p><p><small>Source: www.osteoporosis.org.au</small></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

It was the result of his cutting-edge doctoral research with Professor Fariba Dehghani in injectable hydrogels which laid the foundations for Trimph.</p><p>The dynamic properties of this biomaterial are what make it revolutionary in injury treatment and prevention. At room temperature, Trimph remains a liquid that can be injected into the affected area. Once at body temperature, the gel changes its elasticity to provide the scaffolding required to aid the repair of damaged tissue. The gel then gradually dissolves into non-toxic components and is absorbed into the body. By utilising this injectable biomaterial, medical professionals can greatly decrease the need for open surgery and the associated risks when treating tissue damage.</p><p>In Trimph's Sydney-based facilities Dr Fathi has now proven scalability, having validated production to provide enough product for almost 200 clinical uses per batch. Dr Fathi's research team have completed animal trials and are now a month into human trials. The early signs are very positive.</p><p>\"We have shown that the Trimph is very easy to use, clinicians can save hours in the theatres by using this novel technique. Additionally, preliminary clinical results have shown that we can significantly accelerate the healing time in the body.

It was because of their initial support that I could incorporate the company, raise capital from private and public sources and form this business that now it employs five smart and highly skilled individuals,\" said Dr Fathi.</p><p>In addition to funding from the state and federal governments, Dr Fathi's work has been lauded by Innovation and Science Australia chair Bill Ferris who told the ABC in a recent interview that Trimph \" is the sort of start-up that can affect health outcomes here and abroad.*</p><p>In December 2016 Dr Fathi received a Nobel Award for Local Technology Start-Ups at a Nobel Gala event in Sydney hosted by Cicada Innovations, one of Australia's leading incubators of emerging tech start-ups. The first of its kind in the southern hemisphere, the Nobel Gala replicated the world-renowned Nobel Award experience at Australian Technology Park. In addition to the start-up founders, guests included Federal and State Ministers, Chief Executive Officers from industry and university stakeholders.</p><p>\"This night shows the university\u2013industry culture has been changed and now we can have policy makers, academics, CEOs from multinational corporates and founders of start-ups under one roof, talking about innovation, advanced technologies and manufacturing to form the future of the country,\" said Dr Fathi.</p><p>Dr Fathi completed his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering in Iran. After completing his studies, he worked for the Ford Motor Company's Dagenham Plant in London as a junior mechanical engineer. Dr Fathi believed that the routine nature of this job wasn't satisfying him and so he moved to Australia to complete a Master of Professional Engineering at the University of Sydney. It was here where Dr Fathi decided to pursue the PhD which ultimately led to his ground-breaking work in polymer hydrogels.</p><p>\"We have shown that Trimph is well-tolerated in the body and it can help the regeneration of bone,\" Dr Fathi states. \"It is just the beginning; to be able to register the product for public use we have a long and challenging way to go,\" said Dr Fathi.</p><p>Dr Fathi founded Trimph with fellow alum Terence Abrams who completed his Bachelor in Chemical Engineering at the University of Sydney. In true start-up fashion, the pair have now transformed an old warehouse into a clean room production facility in the heart of Alexandria \u2013 something that is common in San Francisco but virtually unheard of here in Australia. From here Dr Fathi will press on with getting Trimph gel to market, perhaps continuing the same fast pace of success he has already achieved in reaching human trials.</p><p>*Source: &lt;Cicada Innovations inaugural Nobel Gala, ABC News Breakfast BF&gt; viewed 17 May 2017</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

When the amputee abducts their shoulder a cable on the harness is pulled and the prosthetic grip type is changed, for example from hand open to hand close.</p><p>Dr Bobyn and Kristina have designed a harness system which not only compensates for shoulder movements but uses the abdomen and sides to pull different cables, resulting in a wider range of grip patterns and degrees of freedom.</p><p>The added bonus will be the potential cost of the new prosthesis.</p><p>\"Simple upper limb prostheses utilising a\u00a0mechanical hook offer the most cost effective option. Their function is extremely limited, but they are durable. These may cost upwards of $3000. At the other end of the spectrum are myoelectric limbs with multiple degrees of freedom with a cost of tens of thousands of dollars. They are significantly less durable than their mechanical counterparts and are also limited by their reliance on battery\", says Dr Bobyn.</p><p>\"We propose a limb that can be built by the user for\u00a0a hundred dollars that offers the durability and dependability of contemporary mechanical limbs, with the freedom of high-end myoelectric limbs.\"</p><p>Currently in prototyping stage, Kristina is working to increase the modularity of the system to allow the user to easily customise the grip patterns of the hand, as well as improve harness comfort and functionality.</p><p>\"I have always had a passion for maths and science and wanted to apply these skills in a practical way \u2013 something with a strong humanitarian focus\", adds Kristina. \"Biomedical engineering at the University of Sydney has allowed me to think critically, learn about how technology works and hopefully apply these skills to improve the lives of people on a grand scale.\"</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Using natural gas as a feedstock and unprocessed iron ore as a catalyst, it has the potential to become the world's cleanest and cheapest means of supplying global markets with high-quality graphite, hydrogen and clean energy.</p><p>The commercialisation of the Hazer Process will give Australia's clean energy industry a clear competitive advantage and offer valuable alternatives to the export of raw primary commodities. On a global scale it has the potential to lower the costs and increase the availability of clean energy supply worldwide.</p><p>Hazer Group Managing Director Geoff Pocock says the partnership will combine the two organisations' expertise and resources to fully realise the technological and commercial potential of the novel technology.</p><p>\"We believe that the Hazer Process has the potential to be the most successful commercialisation of pure university research in Australia\", Mr Pocock said, \"and this commercialisation has been greatly assisted by the relationship we have built with the University of Sydney\".\u00a0</p><p>The opportunity to partner with Hazer Group was a perfect fit for the University of Sydney's engineers, whose research focuses on solving today's challenges and anticipating those of the future.</p><p>Professor <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/dianne.wiley.php\">Dianne Wiley</a>, Head of School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Sydney said, \"With global warming an ongoing challenge and worldwide demand for affordable clean energy on the rise, our partnership with Hazer Group will ensure that this pioneering technological innovation benefits the greatest possible number of people worldwide\".</p><p>Graphite and hydrogen are both critical ingredients in the clean energy industry, as well as in a range of other important industries.</p><p>Graphite is an essential component of batteries, among other things, including the lithium-ion batteries that power computers, mobile devices and electric vehicles. In 2013 the value of the global graphite market exceeded US$13.6 billion, with the expanding energy market rapidly driving up demand. The graphite produced by the Hazer Process is high-quality, highly crystalline synthetic graphite of high purity, which can be produced in a range of morphologies to suit specific markets and applications.</p><p>The cheap, clean hydrogen produced by the Hazer Process can also be used in a wide range of existing and emerging applications, both within the clean energy market and in large-scale industrial processing. The global hydrogen market is currently valued at more than US$100 billion and, by lowering the costs and environmental impacts of production, the Hazer Process could see it grow.</p><p>\"We're excited about the potential for this partnership to revolutionise the global market for clean energy and other clean technologies\", said Professor Wiley.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

The award recognises Professor Pratt's role as a forward-thinker leader in his field and celebrates his visionary thought leadership.</p><p>Professor Pratt's fascination with science started early. By the age of 13 he was building radios and oscilloscopes with parts from army surplus stores. At 15 he moved onto theoretical physics, which led, eight years later, to his graduation from the University of Sydney with double honours in pure mathematics and physics. It was in the Physics Department that he discovered the emerging subject of computing, which would become a major part of his life's work.</p><p>\"I found computing so extraordinarily different from the other physics departments that I fell in love with the subject,\" Professor Pratt said.\u00a0</p><p>\"I designed, built and demonstrated a computer that could play 'noughts and crosses' capable of only winning or drawing, although at the time I knew nothing about how real computers worked or how to program them.\"</p><p>In 1976 he invented Dynamic Logic, a method of reasoning about computer programs. The richness of this idea has seen it used in linguistics and philosophy. It has had a recent resurgence in the design of high-speed digital electronics.</p><p>In the early 1980s, when computer technology was rapidly evolving from a corporate and government tool into a device almost every home would eventually have, Professor Pratt helped to found one of the most influential computer companies, Sun Microsystems. In 1980 he became the unofficial faculty leader of the highly influential Sun workstation project, developing a modular computer system that gave rise to various commercial products.\u00a0</p><p>In 2006 he was a member of the Stanford team that created Stanley, a self-driving car that won the DARPA high-speed desert driving competition.</p><p>Professor Pratt traces his current work on climate change and debunking the fallacies of climate-change denialism back to his university days. In the 1960s, he was taught about the greenhouse effect and he was unhappy to see so much of that information later ignored or misrepresented in the media.\u00a0</p><p>Professor\u00a0<a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/judy.kay.php\">Judy Kay</a>\u00a0from the <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/school-of-computer-science.html\">School of Information Technologies</a> sees Professor Pratt as a leading innovator in computer science with an illustrious career.\u00a0</p><p>\"He is an outstanding computer scientist, innovator and entrepreneur who has had a wide impact on the world through his work.

We want these biosensors to indicate not only concussive single impacts but also tell us when several smaller impacts could add up to a concussion,\" he said.</p><p>\"At the moment we are in the prototype stage, however the plan is to implant this technology into a mouthguard. The hope is when a force that is likely to result in a concussion or brain injury is detected, the mouthguard will change colour or vibrate, alerting the player, training staff and referee to the injury.</p><p>\"We hope that by developing a mouthguard it will be something that will become available to players at all levels of sport \u2013 from amateur through to fully professional athletes.\"</p><p>The team's work forms a vital part of multi-disciplinary research into the causes, assessments and treatment of concussion in sport.</p><p>Led by neuro-ophthalmologist Associate Professor\u00a0<a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/people/academics/profiles/clare.fraser.php\">Clare Fraser</a>\u00a0of the University of Sydney's\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.savesightinstitute.org.au/about-us/overview/\">Save Sight Institute</a>\u00a0and Dr Adrian Cohen, an adjunct senior lecturer at\u00a0<a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/people/academics/profiles/clare.fraser.php\">Sydney Medical School</a>\u00a0and founder of\u00a0<a href=\"http://headsafe.com.au/\">Headsafe</a>, the research aims to prevent health effects that result in long-term harm and even death.</p><p>With no accepted, singular diagnostic tool for concussion, the team is working with Randwick Rugby Union Club to validate concussion tests that will aid the development of a more accurate system to diagnose mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI).</p><p>The researchers have worked with the club for the past three years, collecting data from a range of tests including XPatch accelerometers attached to players, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), cognitive tests, balance tests, salivary biomarkers and MRIs. So far this data has allowed researchers to compile baseline metrics that is improving the detection and diagnosis of concussion in players tested during and after games.</p><p>Dr Cohen said the aim of the research was to develop a set of objective tests and measurements to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of concussion.</p><p>\"Concussion reflects the amount of energy the brain absorbs from an impact and can be very difficult to diagnose\", he said.</p><p>\"Less than 10 percent of people who suffer a concussion are knocked out and many symptoms are not apparent to those watching. We need to take the subjectivity out of it.\"</p><p>Associate Professor Fraser is researching how the processing of information from the eyes can be used to diagnose concussion. She said the main issue when addressing concussion was its broad definition and underestimated danger to player health.</p><p>\"Our main concerns regarding mTBI surround the lack of strong diagnostic criteria and that there are a lack of objective markers for diagnosis. Players risk serious health complications if they return to play too soon\", she said.</p><p>\"They risk ongoing brain injury if they receive a second impact before recovering from the first. Players also risk long term degenerative brain diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), dementia, personality/mood changes and psychological disturbance including depression.\"</p><p>The goal for the researchers is to develop a test that can accurately and objectively diagnose concussion and be used by non-medical professionals at all levels of sport with a view to preventing long-lasting damage, especially to developing brains in children and adolescents. It is believed that visual testing may prove to be the most reliable, portable and easiest to implement test in schools and amateur sports.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, only professional sports teams have doctors on the sidelines\", said Associate Professor Fraser.</p><p>\"We hope our research will improve the way concussion is diagnosed across all grades of sport and will make it safer for all players. In particular, we hope these tests can be used by sports trainers, coaches and teachers to guide them on when to remove a player from the field and send them for assessment and possible treatment.\"</p><p>Dr Cohen said the research team wasn't trying to \"soften\" sport but make it safer for athletes and educate sports teams and the community about head injuries.</p><p>\"Sport has so many positive benefits but we need to ensure players are aware of the risks they are taking. We also need to increase our understanding to give participants and their families confidence that we are looking after them throughout their careers and after they stop playing.\"</p><p>Dr Cohen is also the founder of not-for-profit charity Headsafe, and is extending a global Rugby Player Health Research Project to Australia. An online questionnaire covers general and psychological health, whilst specialised visual, TMS, MRI and biomarker tests on retired Australian rugby, rugby league, AFL, equestrian and non-contact athletes will add to this important international collaboration with centres from the UK, New Zealand and Canada.

In 2010 he co-founded Whereoscope, a location-aware smartphone app that helped parents keep tabs on their children, which was sold to Facebook and Zynga.</p><p>From 2012 to 2013 Mick led the mobile product team at Facebook across iOS, Android and mobile web. The key improvements to the platform helped grow Facebook's mobile usage from 430M to 945M monthly users using 7000 different types of devices. From here Mick led product development for the Search and Language team where his team grew the daily searches from 750 million to over 1.3 billion across mobile and desktop, and developed Facebook's first products in speech recognition and machine translation.</p><p>Where did this success start? Mick graduated with the University Medal in Computer Science from the University of Sydney in 2002, where he was also a recipient of the Chancellor's Industry Scholarship in Engineering. In 2015 he received the Faculty of Engineering and IT\u2019s Alumni Award for International Achievement.</p><p>Mick talks to us about his many challenging decisions, from the time he chose to study computer science, to passing up a job at Google to persevere with his startup, even though he'd not had a steady wage for a year.</p><h2>What do you enjoy most about your current role?</h2><p>As a startup founder, the only hard limits on what you do are internal \u2013 you and your team can go after anything. I love the challenge of getting up every day, trying to build something that will fundamentally change the world, and knowing that we only have ourselves to blame if we fail.</p><h2>Why did you decide to do a degree in computing?</h2><p>At the time, I wanted to work in photovoltaics. I got a scholarship (CISE) for electrical engineering and planned to do that, followed by a postgraduate degree in solar cells. However, after two years interning at power companies, I found that AI was what I found most interesting and so I switched to computer science.</p><h2>What do you remember enjoying most during your time at the University of Sydney?</h2><p>The sense of camaraderie and fun within the faculty was pretty great. Many of my closest friends are people I met at that time, and funnily enough many of them are also in Silicon Valley these days.</p><h2>Have there been any pivotal moments or choices made during your career that have impacted your success or progress? What did you learn from that experience?</h2><p>In 2010 I was trying to decide whether to take a job as a Google Product Manager in Tokyo, or stick with my startup and my co-founder to go through YCombinator [which provides seed funding at the earliest stages of a new venture]. I hadn't had a real salary in a year or so and the Google job looked really fun and interesting. But I couldn't let my co-founder down; I knew that if our startup succeeded the opportunity was far greater than anything I could achieve at Google. The lesson for me was that important decisions are never easy and hard choices always come up. But when you come up against a hard choice, just be thankful you are in a place to make that decision.</p><h2>What advice would you give to a young person considering studying engineering or IT?</h2><p>Engineering and IT will be as fundamental to human life over the next few decades as the written alphabet has been until now. Knowing how to understand and control software systems will be as normal as driving cars is today \u2013 ironically an activity that will itself disappear.</p><h2>What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in your field of expertise in the next five years?</h2><p>Programming AI technology has always been something that required computer science expertise, but as AI gets more and more mature, there will be a massive opportunity to interact with such agents without that expertise. Imagine being a landscape designer instructing a fleet of small robots on how to reconfigure a garden, or being able to customise a piece of clothing to someone's exact dimensions as they stand in front of you. The platforms to bring together specialised AI and robotic labour, such that anyone in the world can use them, still need to be built \u2013 hopefully by you!</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

In his student days, he acted as a postgraduate tutor and was actively involved in the Sydney University Rugby Club, touring California with the first-grade team in 1974.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p>In his professional career, Malcolm is best known for the introduction of reinforced earth technology to Australia. Having served the Reinforced Earth Company in various roles from 1976 to his Chairmanship in 1999, Malcolm was responsible for the strategic direction of the Groupe TAI Company in Australia and New Zealand as well as the technical development, standards, communication and assistance for the COMTECH group. Reinforced earth technology has become a fundamental component of a civil engineer\u2019s toolkit for solving many earth retaining problems, especially in infrastructure.</p><p>Amidst a busy professional life, Malcolm always found time for his voluntary commitments to the Faculty of Engineering and IT, and his connections within the School of Civil Engineering. Serving as President of the Civil Engineering Foundation from 1991\u20131997 and again in 2000\u20132002, Malcolm secured resources to ensure that the School remained at the forefront of civil engineering research and education in Australia.</p><p>He served on the Dean's Industry Advisory Council for 10 years from 1996, helping to strategically develop the interaction between the Faculty, students, industry and the community, before becoming a Supervisor to the Faculty\u2019s brightest Advanced Engineering students in 2007.</p><p>Acting as Chief Operating Officer and then Project Officer with the Warren Centre for Advanced Engineering from 2010 to 2015, Malcolm helped to bring industry, government and academia together to create thought leadership in engineering, technology and innovation within the Faculty.\u00a0</p><p>As Foundation Officer and then Executive Officer for the Council for Civil Engineering Sydney, Malcolm had an \u201cunprecedented focus, systematically enhancing the School\u2019s engagement with industry,\u201d says Professor Kim Rasmussen, Associate Dean Research, and Head of the School of Civil Engineering from 2005 to 2016.</p><p>Malcolm added an industry perspective to multiple reviews of the School\u2019s educational programs and contributed richly to several accreditation interviews by Engineers Australia. He arranged seminars by leading national and international practitioners as a means of connecting students and staff to industry and drew on his network of industry contacts to help students find industry placement in their later years of study.</p><p>The School expanded rapidly during his term in office, doubling in student and staff numbers, and appointed many junior academics who, being educated at foreign institutions, had few contacts with Australian industry. Malcolm played a leading role in creating a \u201cdating\u201d service for these young academics to visit and connect with practitioners to identify engineering problems in need of solution. At a time when Government is becoming increasingly focused on seeing research translated into industry practice, these connections are proving pivotal for the continued success and high rankings of the School.</p><p>\u201cIf any non-staff member can be said to be \u2018<i>rusted on\u2019</i> to the Faculty and the School, it is Malcolm,\u201d says Professor Brian Uy, current Head of School of Civil Engineering. \u201cWe owe him a great debt of thanks for his service. But I suspect that, while he is retiring from his formal position, Malcolm will likely continue his service and connections to the University in other ways.

These experts are committed to solving real-world problems and shaping the future of our societies. Science and technology are now evolving at a much faster pace than ever before, and I could really see these changes through the deep discussions between world leaders, political figures and scientists. The unique feature of the meeting was the diversity of sessions, discussions and forums. Everyone was passionate about making changes to improve the state of the world.</p><h4><b>What is next for you?</b></h4><p>I am continually working with World Economic Forums in different communities and technical discussions.

Robots boosting food security in the Pacific</strong></h2><p>An inexpensive way for small-scale farmers to increase crop yields, particularly of nutritious foods, in developing countries is on the horizon thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/news-and-events/2018/08/03/digital-farmhand-boosts-food-security-in-the-pacific.html\">Digital FarmHand</a>. Engineered by the <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html\">Australian Centre for Field Robotics</a>, the robot uses low-cost, open-source technology to read crop information in real-time via a smartphone to provide an immense amount of data to the grower. Trials are currently being undertaken in Fiji and Samoa.</p><h2><strong>2. Innovative processing techniques for human milk</strong></h2><p>An underlying interest in human nutrition is the catalyst for PhD candidate Katherine Blackshaw\u2019s research into the preservation of human breast milk \u2013 the primary source of nutrition for newborn babies. Her project is investigating the viability of freeze-dried donated human milk, alternative pathogen control options and thermal treatment to preserve the immune function of milk.</p><h2><strong>3. Better ways to energise the community</strong></h2><p>Sustainable energy systems are evolving within and isolated from conventional energy systems, bringing a level of variability that must be understood. Fortunately, the research of sustainable engineer Elizabeth Tomc is helping to shed light on this area, exploring the implementation of renewable energy networks in new developments using holistic approaches that address technology, finance, ownership and governance.</p><h2><strong>4. Finally understanding housing markets</strong></h2><p>Home\u00a0may be where the heart is but for many owning such an abode is simply a pipedream due to unpredictable housing markets and trends. However, there is hope for future prospective home buyers courtesy of complex systems researcher Kirill Glavatskiy. His project aims to model the behaviour of the housing market with capacity to measure, predict and mitigate systematic risks. Best of all, it intends to provide specific guidelines to economic policymakers.</p><h2><strong>5. Improving cybersecurity in the Internet of Things</strong></h2><p>The Internet of Things offers new ways for businesses to create value, however the constant connectivity and data sharing also creates new opportunities for information to be compromised. That\u2019s why IoT engineer Abubakar Sadiq Sani is creating a cybersecurity toolkit, designing lightweight cryptographic protocols and building real-time cybersecurity awareness, decision making, and risk assessment models to identify and overcome cybersecurity problems.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

(essentially trillions of megabytes), its genesis stemmed from the company\u2019s desire to reduce its dependence on other external parties for storage and ultimately provide a better user

spanning storage systems, databases and filesystems but my largest project has been leading the design and implementation of \u2018Magic Pocket\u2019.</p><p>\u201cIt was a very demanding project, but a tremendous opportunity and a really gratifying experience to work closely with people I deeply respect.\u201d</p><p>Launching publicly in 2016, the project required James and his team to build a system geared to Dropbox\u2019s specific needs that could be upscaled as required, and to architect the data migration.</p><p>Crucial to the design and build phase included the design of a new storage software system and storage hardware based on shingled magnetic recording (SMR) technology \u2013 a dense data recording technique in which one track on a hard drive is partly overwritten by the next, similar to the position of shingles overlapping on a roof.</p><p>Dubbed \u2018Diskotech\u2019, the creation of a compact unit of storage capable of holding a petabyte (PB) of data (one quadrillion bytes) was also instrumental to the project and measured slightly longer than a standard rackmount server tray yet only 4U (18 centimetres) in a rack.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div

loss of data,\u201d says James.</p><p>The University of Sydney alumnus had been at Dropbox for less than a year when initially tasked lead that that \u2018once-in-a-lifetime\u2019 project.</p><p>Prior to joining the technology firm, James was undertaking his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), specialising in distributed systems and consensus protocols.</p><p>His doctorate was to be the final piece of the puzzle before he set out on his originally intended career path \u2013 one he ultimately did not pursue.</p><p>\u201cMy original aspiration was to become a professor and move back to Australia where I would hopefully have my own research group one day,\u201d says James.</p><p>\u201cThis had been my intention right up towards the end of my PhD program and my seven years at MIT. However, as I got closer to my graduation, I couldn\u2019t shake the desire to get out and build things.</p><p>\u201cDropbox had a lot going for it as a company and felt like the smallest place I could find that had very large engineering challenges.\u201d</p><p>Despite this change of heart, James notes that his success abroad in part stems back to his experiences while studying within the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering.html\">Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies</a>.</p><p>\u201cMy computer science degree served as really great preparation for my further studies abroad,\u201d says James.</p><p>\u201cI received an exchange scholarship while at the University of Sydney which encouraged me to leave my comfort zone and spend a semester aboard studying in the United States. I would never be where I am now if it hadn\u2019t been forced to leave the nest and discover opportunities I hadn\u2019t previously entertained.</p><p>\u201cMy Honours year at the University of Sydney also gave me a taste of research and encouraged me to pursue a PhD after graduation.

But its foundations were built on the strong research program in the <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/school-of-aerospace-mechanical-and-mechatronic-engineering.html\">School of Aeronautical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering</a> that decade, growing out of Materials research which drove the move into biomaterials and Rheology which led to soft tissue biomechanics research.</p><p>It was this rapid rise of biomaterials research that led to Andrew Ruys\u2019 recruitment as a prestigious Sydney University U2000 Fellow, undertaking research on ZTA nanocomposites and functionally-graded biomaterials. He was awarded an ARC Queen Elizabeth II Senior Research Fellowship and led both the Biomaterials Research group and the School\u2019s biomedical engineering program from 2003. Ruys became Director of Biomedical Engineering (Education) Faculty-wide and co-director of the <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/biomedical-engineering/institute-of-biomedical-engineering-and-technology.html\">Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology</a> (BMET) in 2010. Two years later, he was promoted to Professor \u2013 the School\u2019s first in Biomedical Engineering.</p><p>During his three decades of research excellence in biomaterials and tissue engineering, Professor Ruys has been responsible for a number of world firsts in research including the development of a spinal disk prosthesis that mimics the structure of the spinal disk, the discovery of the gas exudation mechanism in sintered HAp bioceramics, and the publication of the seminal paper on silicon-doped hydroxyapatite bioceramics for enhanced bioactivity, which is now a key paradigm in bioactivity enhancement.</p><p>More than academic achievement, Professor Ruys has had a profound impact on the student community during his time at the University, fostering links with industry and facilitating the internship and graduate opportunities that have underpinned the program\u2019s success. Wanting to create an \u2018esprit de corps\u2019 around biomedical engineering, Ruys founded the student society, Sydney University Association of Biomedical Engineers (<a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/study-engineering-and-it/why-study-here/student-experience.html\">SUABE</a>) in 2004 and implemented its lunchtime industry seminar program where students could network with visiting industry speakers and their employers.</p><p>\u2018I am very proud of SUABE,\u2019 says Professor Ruys. \u2018It\u2019s now Australia's largest\u00a0student\u2013industry body in the biomedical engineering field with over 250 students, alumni and industry guests at their biannual events.\u2019\u00a0</p><p>Ruys\u2019 passion for connecting students with industry continued with the uniquely named and operated \u2018Magical Mystery Tour\u2019. The tour bus, complete with its namesake Beatles signage, was an on-the-road class for his third-year Biomedical Design and Technology students visiting biomedical companies each week of semester 2 for several years until the ever-growing class numbers made it impractical.</p><p>No doubt Ruys\u2019 innovative approach to education has contributed to the growth of the undergraduate degree at Sydney. When he was appointed Senior lecturer in 2003, there were only 15 enrolments. By 2008, Biomedical Engineering had achieved the highest first-year enrolment of any course in the Faculty with 74 students. Today the degree has almost 10 times that number of students enrolled\u2013 half of these being young women \u2013 and the course spans four Schools encompassing mechanical, mechatronic, electrical and chemical engineering as well as information technologies.</p><p>\u2018Andrew Ruys has been an instrumental part of our Biomedical Engineering program for the past three decades, guiding it very ably through an astonishing period of growth. His ability to connect research outcomes, industry engagement and a focus on the student experience has made this a truly comprehensive program that is training our next generation of Biomedical Engineers and preparing them for careers in an area of high growth,\u2019 says Professor Stefan Williams, Head of the School of Aeronautical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering.</p><p>Much of the success of our current biomedical engineering program and the lateral-mindedness and creativity of those he has taught can be tributed to Andrew\u2019s example: his calm open-ended style of mentorship, his vision, practical lead and support in innovation, collegial approach with other disciplines, and strategic linking with clinicians and industry experts,\u2019 says Dr Philip Boughton, the current Biomedical Engineering Program Manager who was also one of Professor Ruys\u2019 PhD students.</p><p>\u2018I see a bright future for Sydney University\u2019s Biomedical Engineering program,\u2019 says Ruys. \u2018It is the fastest growing branch of engineering today and\u00a0a priority area for the University.

My hearing had started to deteriorate in my early 40s and while my mother had bi-lateral cochlear implants (CIs), I was told the condition was not necessarily hereditary.</p><p>Even with hearing aids, speech became increasingly difficult for me to understand, but even more so when there was background noise. I could comprehend less than 50% of speech with my right ear and almost nothing with my left ear, which was frustrating not only for me but for family, friends and work colleagues.</p><p>As my hearing deteriorated, I wondered if my 30+ years\u2019 technical knowledge as an Electrical Engineer in the telecommunications industry and my personal experience of hearing disability might provide new insights into the challenges facing CI recipients.</p><p>Motivated by a desire to make a real difference, I started a PhD research degree in 2014 and then later transferred to the University of Sydney under the supervision of Professor <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/gregg.suaning\">Gregg Suaning</a> \u2013 a global leader in implantable bionics \u2013 and Dr Brett Swanson, a research scientist at Cochlear.</p><p>Receiving my own CI in my left ear earlier this year has been a life-changing experience. My hearing has significantly improved, and the concentration required to understand speech has dramatically reduced.</p><p>People with CIs often learn to understand 90% or more of speech in ideal conditions. With background noise or multiple people speaking, speech perception is much worse. I\u2019m experiencing these challenges first-hand as I learn to hear again with my left ear. Restaurants, family gatherings and business meetings have all been challenging to navigate.</p><p>\u00a0</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p>Sound processor improvements, that might make speech clearer, are typically tested by playing recorded sentences to experienced implant recipients under a range of test conditions. The recipients repeat the sentence and a score, determined by the accuracy of the repetition, is assigned.</p><p>Alternatively, a mathematical model (or metric) could be used to predict speech intelligibility. With this approach, sound processing improvement ideas could be evaluated by computer simulation and then the most promising ideas tested with recipients. The metric could possibly be used to optimally configure an implant for an individual. The problem is that, while many such metrics have been proposed over the years, few of them have been specifically designed for CIs.</p><p>My research is investigating a metric called \u201cOutput Signal to Noise Ratio\u201d (OSNR) and how well this predicts speech intelligibility for CI recipients. In a typical listening situation, people hear speech and background noise such as chatter or traffic noise. We call the ratio of speech to noise the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). When a CI recipient\u2019s sound processor converts sound to nerve stimulation waveforms, the SNR that is heard by the recipient is changed. The idea of the metric is that the recipient\u2019s level of speech understanding will be determined by the SNR that they actually hear \u2013 the OSNR.</p><p>To date, I\u2019ve shown that OSNR is an accurate predictor in many situations, including more complex scenarios where other metrics fail. The next step is to take existing hearing test data for one test condition, and to use OSNR to predict intelligibility under a different test conditions. If this is feasible, it will open the door for the development of CI algorithms and configurations that are optimised for an individual\u2019s hearing abilities.</p><p>As an engineer I apply my technical skills to find solutions to real-life problems. My passion for biomedical engineering lies in applying sophisticated theoretical concepts to develop innovative healthcare solutions that change peoples\u2019 lives.</p><p>I was asked recently if being able to hear with my CI had made a difference to my life.

If drone technology is to fulfil its potential to revolutionise aerial crop surveys, battlefield intelligence, disaster relief planning and a host of other fields, it must conquer this middle ground.</p><p>The challenges of reconciling the conflicting imperatives for the next generation of drones are formidable. Fast drones with the capacity to spend substantial time in the air need bigger and heavier propulsion systems, reducing the potential payload, and tend to require runways or other infrastructure for launch and recovery.\u00a0</p><p>Teams at the University of Sydney\u2019s UAV Aeronautical Engineering Group, part of the <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/\">Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies</a>, are in the vanguard of addressing these challenges, testing promising new hybrid propulsion systems and re-imagining airframe design to improve functionality.</p><p>Battery power may suffice for small recreational drones, but for more heavy-duty applications that need better range and a bigger payload, they are too heavy and discharge too quickly. Similarly, traditional piston engines are too heavy and bulky for small drones.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p>Dr <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/dries.verstraete.php\">Dries\u00a0Verstraete</a>'s\u00a0team from the University\u2019s <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/school-of-aerospace-mechanical-and-mechatronic-engineering.html\">School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering</a> (AMME) is developing what it calls a Triple Hybrid Fuel Cell system which has up to four times the endurance of current battery systems. Fuel cells coupled with a battery have a number of significant advantages over both standard electric systems and piston engines: they have a better power to weight ratio, they run on hydrogen and produce no pollution, and they produce a much-reduced heat signature, a key concern for military applications.</p><p>But fuel cells quickly degrade if they are asked to handle rapid fluctuations in power demand. The Sydney team has added an ultracapacitor to the fuel cell/battery combination, which smoothes out the load, giving significantly better engine life. Dr Verstraete says that the basic engineering problems have largely been solved, and that the team is now working on optimisation, particularly on the power electronics needed to tune the system for particular missions.</p><p>But the AMME team are looking beyond propulsion to re-engineer the shape of drones of the future. This involves solving a key contradiction: the drone has to have the efficiency and endurance of a fixed-wing aircraft but the easy launch of a multi-rotor aircraft.</p><p>One solution developed in Sydney has been the T-wing Tail-Sitter, a design that takes off vertically before transitioning in mid-air to mimic forward, fixed-wing flight. This will allow the drone to take full advantage of the extra endurance of the hybrid motor. Soldiers looking for battlefield intelligence, farmers carrying out crop surveys, oil or electricity companies looking to check the integrity of their pipelines or distribution cables can launch and retrieve the drone in the field.</p><p><a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/perl-bin/phlookup.cgi?name=Jeremy*%20Randle*&amp;type=people\">Jeremy Randle</a>, the University\u2019s Chief Remote Pilot, has recently returned from testing a system that tracks radio transmitters fitted to one of Australia\u2019s most endangered birds, the Swift Parrot.

In the example of the Swift Parrot, this means that researchers can identify their feeding grounds, but cannot follow them back to their roost in real time, leaving significant gaps in their knowledge.</p><p>\u201cWhat will have to come to maximise the potential is the ability to fly beyond visual range, and that is very difficult within existing rules,\u201d he says. He points out that solving the problem of drone endurance is of little use if it cannot be fully utilised. \u201cAustralian rural properties tend to be very large, and if drones are to be commercially useful to farmers, they need to be able to fly beyond visual range.\u201d</p><p>Drone technology promises to revolutionise everything from crop management to battlefield intelligence, but before that can happen propulsion and airframe technology needs to advance to improve endurance and payload capacity. With innovations like the Triple Hybrid Fuel Cell and the T-wing, the University of Sydney looks set to lead the towards a new generation of drones that will revolutionise the lives of farmers, surveyors and soldiers.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

We decided to move the piers out of the water, lengthening the span beyond the range of a balanced cantilever bridge and into the range of a cable-stayed bridge.\u201d</p><p>As Ken and his team soon discovered, there were many challenges associated with this decision to design what would now be the first modern day cable-stayed bridge in Australia.</p><p>The team then needed to incorporate new technologies such as analysis methods and stay cable technology (materials, corrosion protection, installation methods) into the mix.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div class=\"contentContainerMediaObjectModule\n\t\t\t \t\tright width-medium\n\t\t\t \t\t\">\n\t\t\t<div><figure class=\"b-image\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/news-and-events/2018/april/anzac-bridge-statue.JPG/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg\" alt=\"ANZAC Bridge bronze memorial statue\" class=\"b-image__image\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t<figcaption class=\"b-image__caption\">\n\t\t<p>A bronze memorial statue of an Australian Anzac soldier holding a\u00a0rifle in the \"rest on arms reverse\" drill position was placed on the western end of the Anzac Bridge in 2000</p>\n\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><p>They also had to understand the learnings from what had and had not previously worked well on similar international projects, such as the effects of rain and wind vibration of the stay cables which became a real issue near the end of construction.</p><p>\u201cUnder conditions of moderately light winds with coincident rain, the stay cables started to vibrate and the movement of the cables could be alarming to the bridge user,\u201d explains Ken.</p><p>\u201cThis was a phenomenon only recently observed in some Japanese bridges and we needed to quickly understand the causes and how this could be controlled.</p><p>\u201cNowadays this vibration can be simply controlled by adding dampers to the cables or incorporating a spiral bead on the outside of the cable ducting to drain away the rain. Both of these solutions have since been successfully incorporated on the Anzac Bridge.\u201d</p><p>Now semi-retired, Wheeler\u2019s 40-year career has seen him lead the bridge design of such prominent projects as the Bolte Bridge in Melbourne, the main spans for the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane, and the ASEAN Bridge in Sarawak, Malaysia.</p><p>He also managed the construction engineering for the cable-stayed Centennial Bridge over the Panama Canal and the Phu My Bridge in Vietnam, and leading the multi-disciplined design team for Bangladesh\u2019s Padma Multipurpose Bridge, currently under construction.</p><p>Ken was recently awarded Engineers Australia\u2019s 2017 John Connell Gold Medal, a prestigious accolade for structural engineers. He also helped develop the Australian Bridge Design Code AS5100 and has represented NAASRA, Austroads and Consult Australia on Standards Australia committees for steel structures, composite structures and bridge design.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s the culmination of a career that started with his decision early in life to study at the University of Sydney. Aside from his civil engineering degree, Ken also completed a Bachelor of Science in 1974 and Master of Engineering Science in 1984.</p><p>\u201cAs a young boy I always had a keen interest in building things and solving problems and growing up, the University of Sydney was highly regarded for engineering, so it was there that I wanted to complete my studies,\u201d reveals Ken.</p><p>\u201cTheir engineering courses provided a sound technical background to my career, for which I am grateful. Engineering qualifications from the University of Sydney are highly regarded internationally, particularly in South East Asia, and this has been of great assistance in being accepted by clients in these countries.</p><p>\u201cI am pleased that there have been a number of opportunities where we have been able to recommend the University academic staff as corroborators or ask them to confirm our technical approach in specific engineering areas, such as during the detailed design of the Anzac Bridge and the Gateway Bridge.\u201d</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

However, her successful modelling career took her overseas to London and she went on to graduate in Medicine at the University of Oxford in the UK.</p><p>She currently practices as a doctor in London and is now developing health technology platforms while completing a master's degree in the neuroscience and psychology of mental health.</p><p>The British Medical Association's Young Author of the Year 2016, Rachel has written two medical text books (Practical Medical Procedures at a Glance and Medical School at a Glance) as well as peer-reviewed journal articles.</p><p>If it were possible to fit anything more into her busy professional life, Rachel also manages to speak at schools, universities and institutions to encourage more young women into Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) or Medicine. We asked Rachel what drives her passion and what vision she sees coming into fruition in the next five years for biomedical engineering in the personalised medical field.</p><h3>What do you enjoy most about your current role?</h3><p>I enjoy the challenge of solving healthcare-related problems. I'm fortunate to be able to do this in different ways: clinically with patients as a doctor, by writing education books for healthcare professionals, and through devising technological solutions for larger issues.</p><h3>Why did you decide to do a Bachelor of Engineering (Biomedical)?</h3><p>I was interested in learning how to improve health and healthcare. I felt biomedical engineering could teach a different approach to problem-solving, building (a bridge) between medical technologies and clinical medicine.</p><h3>What do you remember enjoying most during your time at the University?</h3><p>Sydney University provides amazing opportunities to educate yourself in ways you hadn't imagined needing. I was able to study abroad at the University of California, Berkeley, on an exchange scholarship, which was great fun and very interesting. And I was in SUDS (the Sydney University Dramatic Society) which I really enjoyed too.</p><h3>Have there been any pivotal moments or choices made during your career that have impacted your success or progress? What did you learn from that experience?</h3><p>The decision to study medicine after I had completed my biomedical engineering and science double degree has obviously had a big impact on my career. I studied this at Oxford University and was able to learn more, not only about clinical medicine and patient experiences, but also about different healthcare systems.</p><h3>What has been your greatest achievement to date \u2013 something that you are particularly proud of? What helped you to reach that goal?</h3><p>I was honoured to be voted the British Medical Association's 'Best Young Author of the Year, 2016', based on the publication of my medical education books. I was pleased to realise that these books are helping medical students, doctors and healthcare professionals with their training, as well as helping to deliver better quality care to patients.</p><h3>Is there a stand-out innovation or change in your field of expertise that has shifted the way things are done?</h3><p>I think that the increasing use of artificial intelligence in medicine will be for the better. While there is some reluctance to accept it, I think it will free up doctors to spend more time with patients rather than looking at computer screens. And that is a good thing.</p><h3>What advice would you give to a young person considering studying biomedical engineering?</h3><p>Do it! It provides an excellent framework for how to think about different problems and how to devise solutions for them. This is obviously relevant in healthcare, but also in wider areas of service provision and other fields. I am also actively involved in encouraging girls to get and stay involved in science and engineering \u2013 any of the STEM subjects really, as women are still under-represented in these areas.</p><h3>What exciting job opportunities do you see becoming a reality in your field of expertise in the next five years?</h3><p>There is an explosion of fascinating research at the moment. I am currently looking at the neuroscience and psychology of mental health, with a view to a technological solution in this space. Personalised medicine, where therapeutics are targeted depending on your genetic make-up, will start becoming more widespread \u2013 and Biomedical Engineers will be helping this to become a reality.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Many manufacturers rely on ultrafiltration systems to filter their wastewater before allowing it to enter the ecosystem. Ultrafiltration systems utilise specially-designed membranes that allow certain molecules to pass through, separating the water from contaminants. The problem with these systems is the effects of \u2018membrane fouling\u2019, where particles begin to build up on the membrane wall and reduce the system\u2019s ability to effectively filter the fluids passing through.</p><p>At the <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/food-products-process-and-supply-chain/arc-training-centre-for-the-australian-food-processing-industry.html\">ARC Training Centre for the Australian Food Processing Industry</a>, Mahshid Farzanehsa, a PhD candidate in the <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-chemical-and-biomolecular-engineering.html\">School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</a>, is working on solutions to the problem of membrane fouling. Traditionally, fouling is addressed with a washing procedure to recover the flow of the fluid passing through the membrane to its initial state. Mahshid is developing \u2018fouling-resistant\u2019 membranes to maintain a constant flow.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div class=\"contentContainerMediaObjectModule\n\t\t\t \t\twidth-full\n\t\t\t \t\t\">\n\t\t\t<div><figure class=\"b-image\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/news-and-events/2018/february/membrane-technology.png/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.png\" alt=\"Membrane filter technology\" class=\"b-image__image\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t<figcaption class=\"b-image__caption\">\n\t\t<p>Ultrafiltration equipment used for testing in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular laboratory</p>\n\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMembrane fouling seems to be the \u2018Achilles heel\u2019 of membrane filtration technology. Apart from fouling, membrane technology provides a great wastewater treatment solution. They have effective separation rates, whilst taking up very little space. They can also be used to process heat sensitive products such as juice and dairy products\u201d, says Mahshid. If Mahshid can enhance membrane process efficiency, she could save Australia\u2019s food processing industry a significant amount of time, energy and financial resources. It could also mean better access to clean drinking water in rural communities.</p><p>Mahshid recently received an Endeavour scholarship which will enable her to take her research in membrane fouling to the University of British Columbia. There she will expand on her knowledge and experience gained at the University of Sydney to learn novel techniques in fouling elimination being developed in Vancouver.</p><p>\u201cAt the University of British Colombia, I will focus on membrane surface characteristics such as hydrophobicity and surface charge to reduce fouling rate during the filtration of drinkable water. This research will hopefully facilitate and enhance the water filtration process\u201d, says Mahshid. The inspired PhD candidate is set to head to Vancouver, Canada in September this year to continue her search for an answer to Australia\u2019s water shortage.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

The researchers\u2019 work aims to decrease such response times, that are commonly slowed due to poor sharing of computing resources.</p><p>\u201cJust like driving in peak hour, a spike in traffic can cause a bottleneck of requests. We\u2019ve all experienced a slow website \u2014 often the cause is an inundation of requests \u2014 we call this an increase in latency,\u201d explained Oana.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div class=\"contentContainerMediaObjectModule\n\t\t\t \t\twidth-full\n\t\t\t \t\t\">\n\t\t\t<div><figure class=\"b-image\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/news-and-events/2019/august/oana-balmau.png/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.png\" alt=\"Oana Balmau\" class=\"b-image__image\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t<figcaption class=\"b-image__caption\">\n\t\t<p>Oana Balmau is currently studying Computer Science. <i>Photo source: Luisa Low/University of Sydney).</i></p>\n\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><p>Professor Zwaenepoel emphasised that there is a growing need for technology that effectively deals with surges in traffic \u2014 a need that will only become more pronounced as the online world becomes the centre point for most commercial activity.</p><p>\u201cAs more people come online, large online servers are dealing with an increasing level of traffic and requests each day. Our method focuses on generating shorter response times for customer requests to ensure performance predictability and improve user experience,\u201d said Professor Willy Zwaenepoel.</p><p>\u201cThis reliability requires complex infrastructure, however the issue is large online services need to create a predictable experience while dealing with large swathes less-predictable requests.\"</p><p>According to Oana, online systems such as Facebook, Google and iCloud are experiencing a period of rapid expansion. By providing lower latency and better predictability, she believes her research will improve the reliability of data transmission.</p><p>\u201cImprovements might be in seconds or milliseconds, however, this all adds up. Improved latency contributes to greater productivity and a better user experience,\u201d said Oana.</p><p>\u201cWe have designed a scheduler that ensures the computing resources are split productively between the customer requests and routine maintenance work. Our solution ensures that customer requests are never blocked by maintenance work,\u201d she said.</p><p>Usenix ATC is one of the industry\u2019s largest conferences, attended by researchers from across the globe.</p><p>\u201cThis was our very first appearance at Usenix so it\u2019s remarkable that we have won the best paper award!\u201d Professor Zwaenepoel concluded.</p><h4>Disclosure</h4><p>The research has been conducted in collaboration with Silicon Valley software company, Nutanix.

href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/yi-sheng.chen.php\">Yi-Sheng Chen</a> will collaborate with CITIC Metal on research designed to examine how hydrogen embrittlement occurs in steel.</p><p>Hydrogen embrittlement\u00a0refers to the process by which certain metals become susceptible to early fracture due to the absorption of hydrogen.</p><p>\u201cHydrogen wreaks havoc in many alloys, leading to embrittlement that can cause catastrophic failure for any industry in which structures are exposed to this ubiquitous element,\u201d explains Professor Cairney from the <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-aerospace-mechanical-and-mechatronic-engineering.html\">School of Aeronautical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering</a>.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, comprehending the behaviour of hydrogen in these alloys is restrictive due to the actual difficulty of observing tiny, light and mobile hydrogen atoms.\u201d</p><p>Professor Cairney and Dr Chen\u2019s research project intends to explain where hydrogen goes in exposed high-strength steel by 3D-mapping the position of hydrogen atoms at the atomic scale within the alloy.</p><p>This imaging will be enabled by using atom probe tomography, a flagship microscopy technique housed within the <a href=\"http://sydney.edu.au/acmm/\">Australian Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis</a>.</p><p>\u201cOur research will elucidate how a proposed solution, hydrogen trapping, reduces hydrogen embrittlement, contributing to design criteria for hydrogen-resistant steels,\u201d says Professor Cairney.</p><p>\u201cWe intend to replace the hydrogen with deuterium \u2013 the rarer isotope of hydrogen, which has an additional neutron and behaves similarly to hydrogen at atomic scale.</p><p>\u201cIt will also serve to remove any ambiguity caused by the ubiquity of background hydrogen signals within most analytical instruments.</p><p>\u201cThis sample will be kept extremely cold, so that the normally-mobile hydrogen and deuterium atoms stay in place for the atom probe experiment.\u201d</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div

atoms in metals is an important first step towards ultimately designing hydrogen-resistant steels.</p><p>High strength hydrogen-resistant steels will allow lighter components for the automotive industry, which traditionally relies on heavier, thicker traditional steel components to produce the body and chassis of vehicles.</p><p>\u201cHydrogen embrittlement is one of the major limitations to the usage of steel material for fuel-effective light-weight cars,\u201d explains Dr Chen, a University of Sydney Fellow also within the School of Aeronautical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering.</p><p>\u201cA vehicle made out of lighter components requires less energy during service, while offering the same levels of performance.</p><p>\u201cHowever, the current susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement means that steels possessing higher strength and a higher embrittlement risk are generally not considered in the design stage as it compromises safety.\u201d</p><p><a

Teamwork is a major aspect of project management and I think it is important to establish a leadership style. I was team leader so I was responsible for getting items delivered to the client on time. I learnt a lot about team dynamics and how to manage the team to get efficient results.</p><p>I think you learn a lot of theory at University which is why the capstone unit is so significant as it is a real life project, with a schedule and budget you must follow. In a project management career, there is definitely going to be some obstacles during projects, hence learning how to navigate this project during COVID has provided us the necessary skills to overcome barriers.\u00a0</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div class=\"contentContainerMediaObjectModule\n\t\t\t \t\tright width-medium\n\t\t\t \t\t\">\n\t\t\t<div><figure class=\"b-image\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/news-and-events/2020/december/karlo-karlovic-3.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg\" alt=\"Karlo Karlovic\" class=\"b-image__image\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><h4><strong>Karlo Karlovic<br>\n </strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-advanced-computing.html\">Bachelor of Advanced Computing</a><span> student</span></span></h4><h5>What was your capstone unit?</h5><p>For our Information Systems capstone unit (<a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ISYS3888\">ISYS3888</a>), we completed \u2018CS36 - Improving Access to Regulatory Safety Warnings on Medicines - Creation of a searchable Database\u2019</p><h5>What was your project?</h5><p>Our project was\u00a0a 'one-stop-shop' for all drug warnings and advisories. After a drug is made, it undergoes many extensive tests to ensure its safety for use. However, once it is released to the public there is no easy way for medical professionals and users of a drug to find out any newly found impacts of the drug. </p><p>Some of these impacts can only be found after five, ten, or even 15 years after the drug was first released.\u00a0It is therefore vital that people who have and are currently using it are aware of these adverse health effects.</p><p>We aimed to centralise this information and working with the <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre/\">Charles Perkins Centre</a> (CPC) to create this online database provided us with the ability to transfer our well-developed technical skills into a real-world issue. The team at the CPC provided us with great domain knowledge and professional guidance.</p><p>The first thing we completed was to establish a clear scope of work with the client, which included gathering further requirements not specified in the initial document. This was to provide a clear expectation of what the final prototype would look like.</p><p>Once this baseline was established, we worked on an iterative design phase to figure out the design and functionally of the prototype. We then worked on implementing the frontend and backend code that would be required to implement the requirements.</p><p>The most difficult task was importing all the original data into our newly designed database schema. Throughout development, we would continuously update our live site so our client and associates could review development and changes, providing them the ability to make new suggestions and tweaks.</p><p>This occurred iteratively over multiple weeks until we came to the final prototype for handover. We believe we met the initial set of requirements as the client is now looking for ways to use this initial codebase for future use in their original project purpose.</p><h5><strong>What have you learned through this project?</strong></h5><p>Our team had to learn a lot in order to complete this project including learning new frameworks to support the site, registering and hosting a domain, and running routine server maintenance.</p><p>Working with representatives from the Charles Perkins Centre was an extremely rewarding experience. They provided us a real sense of purpose and direction that wasn\u2019t only technically related, but also socially and culturally.</p><p>This project exposed to our group what it meant to work in a team and how the \u2018real\u2019 world works in a now online environment.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div class=\"contentContainerMediaObjectModule\n\t\t\t \t\tright width-medium\n\t\t\t \t\t\">\n\t\t\t<div><figure class=\"b-image\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/news-and-events/2020/december/ab2.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg\" alt=\"Aakanksha Bose\" class=\"b-image__image\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><h4><strong>Aakanksha Bose<br>\n </strong><a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/pc/master-of-data-science.html\" style=\"font-weight: normal;background-color: rgb(255,255,255);\">Master of Data Science</a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> student</span><strong><br>\n</strong></h4><h5>What was your capstone unit?</h5><p><a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/DATA5703\">DATA5703</a>: Data Science Capstone Project</p><h5>What was your project?</h5><p>Our project was predicting the price of electricity in the National Electricity Market (NEM) and building a dashboard for live pricing predictions.</p><p>One of our team members works in the energy industry and presented a problem that interested us all. Though COVID-19 presented its challenges, we ensured to always sync up as a team and check-in with one another.</p><p>Our industry partner <a href=\"https://www.infigenenergy.com/\">Infigen Energy</a> was very happy with the solutions and end product we created and found that it will add benefit to the processes they are already undertaking.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><h5><strong>What have you learned through this project?</strong></h5><p>We were fortunate enough to partner with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.infigenenergy.com/\">Infigen Energy</a>. They were solving a particular problem and our team assisted in reaching their desired outcome and solution. Having never had any experience in the energy market, I learnt a great deal about the processes and strategies applied in pricing/the interconnected dependencies between each state. It was also very interesting to see that 24/7 monitoring is required for resources and the underlying differences between each state\u2019s electricity needs and the corresponding price.</p><p>This project allowed us to work on a real-world problem, where the final outcome may not have been necessarily known. In many of the subjects completed throughout the Master of Data Science, most of the datasets have been explored extensively and the process explicitly defined. Working on this project allowed us to map out the project pipeline from start to finish, which will be invaluable when we carry out projects in our respective careers.</p><p>It also gave us the opportunity to explore models and libraries, which we may not have considered previously. In addition to building our technical skills, it was a chance to enhance soft skills such as communication and stakeholder management. It showed us the importance of taking a complex problem but also presenting it in a way that the everyday user can also understand.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<h5><a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/study/student-experience/industry-placements-and-internships.html\">Learn more</a> about industry opportunities for engineering students.</h5><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

I really didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do, or what I wanted to study when I left school. My first list of course preferences didn\u2019t include engineering, mainly because I didn\u2019t really know what engineers \u2018did\u2019.</p><p>During an interview with someone from the University of Sydney, the interviewer picked up on my love of maths and sciences and suggested I consider engineering.

My favourite awe-inspiring memory is being in the Great Hall (for exams, unfortunately) in the Quad \u2013 amazing.</p><p>My favourite \u2018fun\u2019 experience is all the engineering get-togethers, especially on Friday afternoons and the annual revues. My favourite subject was system dynamics. But most of all I appreciated the people.</p><p>Nearly 30 years after graduating I\u2019m still in contact with many of my fellow engineering students and quite a few of the engineering faculty staff.<br>\n</p><h3>How did your uni degree contribute to your career \u2013 especially early on?</h3><p>My engineering degree has been fundamental to everything I\u2019ve done in my career. It was really the springboard for everything I\u2019ve done since 1993. It turns out that people like the way engineers think \u2013 we typically think in quite a structured way, with an emphasis on logic and we tend to adopt a \u2018systems\u2019 approach to things. That skill set and mindset is very transferrable, so an engineering degree is a versatile and valued qualification to have.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div class=\"contentContainerMediaObjectModule\n\t\t\t \t\tright width-medium\n\t\t\t \t\t\">\n\t\t\t<div><figure class=\"b-image\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/news-and-events/2020/september/jane-macmaster-aircraft.jpeg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg\" alt=\"Jane with her favourite aircraft\" class=\"b-image__image\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t<figcaption class=\"b-image__caption\">\n\t\t<p>Jane with her favourite aircraft</p>\n\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><h3>Can you share a career highlight?</h3><p>Two years after graduating, I was lucky enough to be offered a job with British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) in Melbourne. The position was Thermal Design Engineer for a supersonic flight vehicle (Evolved SeaSparrow Missile system) that provided defence for ships against inbound threats. </p><p>It was a NATO project and Australia was a guest nation for the project. We had responsibility for designing four sub-systems \u2013 the thrust vector controller, the aerodynamic control fins, the dorsal fins and the guidance control algorithms. That project remains the most formative of my career because the teams I worked with (both Australian and international teams) were incredible \u2013 talented and fun.</p><p>I worked on the project from beginning to end \u2013 almost from a \u2018blank sheet of paper\u2019 to the production phase. That is an incredibly valuable learning experience \u2013 to see what is required to get a very complicated system from literally an \u2018artist\u2019s impression\u2019 through to a functioning system onboard ships.</p><p>That project was where I \u2018grew up\u2019 as an engineer and I\u2019ll be forever grateful for the team I worked with during that time for the opportunities and mentoring I was given. What I learnt about a good design process on that project has informed everything I\u2019ve done since.</p><h3>How would you describe the trajectory of your career?</h3><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p>My career has taken a few unexpected turns and I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work in a range of industries and sectors, all of them drawing on my engineering training and experience. I\u2019ve found the varied experience to be valuable because I\u2019ve learnt different ways of thinking and doing things in each of them. When you bring them all together it provides a bigger pool of ideas to draw on when encountering new challenges. That\u2019s definitely been the greatest benefit of having had a varied career. There was no plan for doing that.</p><p>I\u2019ve never really had a grand plan for my career, and while it\u2019s great to have a plan, especially if you know what you want \u2018to do\u2019, it\u2019s also beneficial to build in flexibility to that plan so you can accommodate new opportunities (and challenges) as they arise. The changes in my career have either been because an opportunity arose and I took it, or, in the case of starting my own business, because I felt strongly that there was a gap that I could help fill.</p><p>As it turns out despite the range of roles, industries and sectors I\u2019ve worked in, I\u2019ve woven together a theme from them. I wove all my experiences together to form a generalised model for problem-solving, strategy and design for complex challenges. It draws heavily on engineering principles and techniques but also builds in ideas from other areas such as complexity science, behavioural insights, theory of strategy, general systems theory and others.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<div class=\"contentContainerMediaObjectModule\n\t\t\t \t\twidth-full\n\t\t\t \t\t\">\n\t\t\t<div><figure class=\"b-image\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/dam/corporate/images/faculty-of-engineering-and-information-technologies/news-and-events/2020/september/jane-macmaster-bae.jpeg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg\" alt=\"Jane working at BAE Systems\" class=\"b-image__image\">\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t<figcaption class=\"b-image__caption\">\n\t\t<p>Jane working at BAE Systems</p>\n\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><h3>What is your advice to current engineering students?

I would suggest focusing now on learning, both through your university work and any work experience you may have access to, whether that\u2019s engineering-related or another part-time job (because all work experience is valuable).</p><p>If you have time up your sleeve,</p><ul>\n<li>consider taking some online short courses,</li>\n<li>explore whether there are some companies that offer virtual internships,</li>\n<li>think about working with a mentor,</li>\n<li>talk to your Faculty/School about work experience or mentoring opportunities with industry (and consider this prior to your final year),</li>\n<li>and join some communities of practice or volunteering work.</li>\n</ul><p>Any of these initiatives will help build your knowledge, experience and networks.

I\u2019m sure not every female engineer has low confidence like I did, but if you do, I would just remind you that asking questions, even if you don\u2019t know the answer, is extremely valuable, because it encourages people to think about a valid point that you\u2019ve just raised.</p><p>There is growing recognition of the value of diversity in thought, so try to contribute to discussions when you can. And don\u2019t be afraid of saying something \u2018stupid\u2019 or asking \u2018silly questions\u2019. Goodness knows I\u2019ve said things or asked questions which seem obvious to everyone else many times in the past, and so has everyone else by the way, and that\u2019s just part of learning. The more you learn, the more valuable your insights will become over time.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

It was important to her to prevent this and provide for the health workforce.</p><p><strong>What was your role on the project?</strong></p><p>I have been helping with the administration/external engagement side of the project \u2013 while we were all isolating in our homes, my goal was to keep volunteers engaged and to connect with groups outside of the University who were interested in what the team was creating. I\u2019ve been fortunate to work with people to create our website, liaise with media groups, and try to promote the project as much as possible.</p><p><strong>What have you gained from this experience?</strong></p><p>It\u2019s always great to learn from academics and industry professionals who are involved in the project \u2013 they know so much and can see applications of the theory we get taught as students, and provide insight to how best to take our learned knowledge and turn it into something useful for the real world.</p><p>I have definitely become more practiced at managing a group of people, delegating tasks and asking for contributions from people who are great in their fields. One of the most beneficial things to any project is collaboration from different backgrounds, and seeing clinicians, engineers, and students from all kinds of backgrounds come together has really highlighted the best ways to engage and connect with people.</p><p>A second project focusing on creating and providing PPE to clinicians has grown out of the\u00a0ventilator\u00a0project, and I was fortunate enough to be asked to be part of that team as well.

One role was working with the mechanical team by computer-aided design (CAD) modelling and 3D printing pneumatic components, as well as prototyping valves for these components.</p><p>Another role was working with the industrial design team in designing the user interface. I focussed on gathering information on existing systems, drafting user interface designs and working with other team members on developing the prototype enclosure for the\u00a0ventilator. This was an iterative process which prioritised functionality and simplicity. This involved working closely with our resident clinician Dr Ken Harrison from <a href=\"https://careflight.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CareFlight</a>, as well as the mechanical and electrical teams to ensure all parts came together correctly.</p><p><strong>What have you gained from this experience?</strong></p><p>Working alongside students and staff from other faculties was a great experience since we were all working towards a common objective and trying to utilise whatever resources or skills we could. For example, students and lecturers from the School of Chemistry with past experience in industrial design were volunteering their spare time and dusting off old skills to help on the development of components like the housing prototype.</p><p>This project has helped me develop my knowledge of current skills like CAD modelling and 3D printing. I know much more about pneumatics and mechanical design than I did previously. Working with the industrial design team taught me new skills and showed me what it was like to work outside the field of biomedical engineering.</p><p>I was taught the steps and stages needed to develop a product from more than just an engineering point of view and enjoyed learning something different.</p><p>Working with other teams on a high stress project with limited time and resources meant teamwork, leadership and communication skills were crucial to making progress and ensuring all aspects of the project came together. I think these have been the most valuable skills I was able to develop over the course of this project.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

I wanted to complete my degree under his guidance and I was excited about experiencing a new academic environment. The University of Sydney provided a really friendly and open environment, where I felt supported to conduct my best research. It was also a great experience to spend a few years in a city as vibrant as Sydney.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p>My interest in computing started in high-school in Romania, where I took my first programming class. Even though I found it challenging, I remember the great satisfaction I felt when my first (very simple) programs would run correctly! After that, I was pretty much hooked. I continued this path through my undergraduate studies at EPFL in Switzerland and the journey ultimately brought me to Sydney for the PhD. I think that my parents\u2019 careers also influenced my appreciation for computer science - my mother is a computer scientist and my father is an electrical engineer.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p>My PhD research focused on the design of efficient key-value stores, which have become the standard storage platform for many cloud applications. The kinds of systems I studied in my dissertation are backing the storage infrastructure of companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. I was drawn to this research area because it provides many intellectually stimulating problems, which are also practical. I find this combination very motivating.<strong></strong></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p>I developed several techniques to improve the performance of storage systems, such as making them scale with the degree of multi-threading, taking advantage of large memory sizes, and decreasing the impact of system maintenance on user operations. My designs are conscious of the properties of new storage hardware and thus lead to large performance improvements in terms of throughput and tail latency. This work is practical and can be applied right away to data-centre storage systems. In fact, part of my work is already deployed in industry at Nutanix, a cloud computing company that I have been collaborating with throughout my PhD. </p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p>I felt really happy and honoured that my dissertation was chosen as the winner. In addition to the sense of fulfillment coming from my work being recognized by the community, the visibility generated by winning this award is really important in attracting talented students as a junior academic at McGill.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p>One thing the PhD taught me is that every student experience is different and thus support looks different at each stage of the student journey. I will try to understand the particular situation of each student when advising and teaching and do my best to provide them with the resources that they need to succeed.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZPLXsYoucMYcTMv_yRePY-wJeM8fnK7q/view\">Read Oana's dissertation</a></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>"], "accordions": [], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

Long-term evolution (LTE), as a popular cellular technology, has grown in importance due to its high data rate and better data access technique for mobile devices. However, LTE still may still be limited due to the existing spectrum insufficiency in licensed bands.</p><p>To sustain the possible growth in mobile capacity demand, the unlicensed band is being considered as a supplementary band for LTE and a favourable solution to increase the capacity of mobile systems. Based on the improvement of carrier aggregation, 3GPP has approved a study item that will support LTE by offloading mobile data in the unlicensed band. Hence, LTE will run on the spectrum that overlaps with wi-fi, which is another common unlicensed band technology.

The essential methods of bioimage informatics involve generation, visualisation, analysis and management.

As imaging facilities become increasingly accessible, more and more imaging data are collected from patients with chronic disorders in longitudinal settings. Such big neuroimaging data enables new possibilities to study the brain with high translational impact, such as early detection of the longitudinal changes in the brain, and large-scale evaluation of imaging-based biomarkers.

She has been instrumental in building a multidisciplinary research environment that stimulates the interface and intersect of engineering, science, medicine, pharmacy and agriculture. Her research has led to the:</p><ul>\n<li>design of pragmatic, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable techniques for processing materials</li>\n<li>extraction of high-value and active compounds from natural resources for the treatment and prevention of chronic diseases such as infection and cardiovascular disease</li>\n<li>synthesis of materials for musculoskeletal tissue repairs.</li>\n</ul><p>Her research is renowned in both academia and the food and biotech industries. She has established long-term collaborations within those industries and acquired substantive funding from national and international funding agencies.</p><p>Professor Dehghani has published more than 200 papers, and is an inventor on 13 patents, including nine with potential end users. She had a key role in developing a sterilisation process that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for commercial application. In addition, her research resulted in the establishment of a start-up company that has received approval from the TGA to produce an injectable hydrogel for clinical applications. Professor Dehghani was selected by Engineers Australia as one of the\u00a050 engineers for innovation in research in 2016.</p><p><a name=\"chiefInvestigators\"></a></p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>",

We are investigating ten carbohydrate profiles of four dietary contexts, enabling us to map the effects of dietary nutrition to the gut microbial composition, diversity and activity, as well as impacts on host physiology, metabolism and immunity.</p><p>We aim to gain a perspective on the microbial and host responses to diet, allowing targeted diet manipulations to modify the gut microbiota and influence host health in personal dietary choices and treatment therapies.</p>"}, {"heading": ["In silico and in vitro modelling of diet-host-gut microbe interactions: Engineering gut processes through dietary manipulations targeted at the individual "], "body": "<p><b>Our experts:</b> Professor\u00a0<a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/fariba-dehghani.html\">Fariba Dehghani</a>, Associate Professor\u00a0<a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/andrew-holmes.html\">Andrew Holmes</a>,\u00a0Dr\u00a0<a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dale-mcclure.html\">Dale McClure</a>, Dr <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/mark-read.html\">Mark Read</a></p><p>Our gut contains a complex community made up of millions of microorganisms, these have a large impact on our health. In the gut these microorganisms can interact with each other and our diet to produce compounds which can benefit our health; they can also produce compounds which are not desirable. Understanding the complex interactions in this community is difficult and performing experiments can be very challenging.</p><p>We aim to develop lab and computer-based models of the gut microbiome. The end goal of this project is to develop a tool which can be used to simulate the interactions between microbes in the gut.

This traffic model is considerably different from traditional arrival traffic patterns,which can be modelled using Poisson or Markov-modulated processes. However, empirical evidence supported by deep analysis on workload of today\u2019s applications in several grid and cloud environments showed that the traffic of tasks' arrival is intrinsically bursty and exhibits correlations over longer time scales than the traditional models. In such scenarios that involve applications with heavy-tailed running time tasks, there are relatively few studies on the problem of task scheduling on hybrid cloud resources. One of the key considerations in the design of such a scheduling policy is the concept of Pareto-optimality of multiple objective functions, such as total incurring cost and/or makespan.</p><p>The output of this project will include an implementation of a suggested scheduling algorithm in the real cloud environment, with deep analysis of several well-known workload patterns.</p>"}], "articles": [], "news": [], "call_outs": [], "podcasts": []},

It brings many attractive properties to systems, such as robustness, adaptability and scalability. Self-organising systems can be found almost everywhere: neuronal ensembles self-organise into complex spike patterns; schools of fish change shape in response to approaching predators; and ecosystems develop spatial structures in response to diminishing resources.</p><p>The goal of guided self-organisation (GSO) is to leverage the strengths of self-organisation (that is, its simplicity, parallelisation, adaptability, robustness and scalability) while still being able to direct the outcome of the self-organising process. We approach GSO by examining the information processing within complex systems, especially near-phase transitions and critical regimes.\u00a0We use information-theoretic measures of complexity, criticality, and computation (\u201cinformation dynamics\u201d) and develop cross-disciplinary methods, relating information theory and thermodynamics (\u201cinformation thermodynamics\u201d), as well as game theory and complex networks.</p><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>", "<h3><a name=\"complex\"></a>Complex networks</h3><p>Networks are ubiquitous in today\u2019s world. Communication networks are changing the way we live and interact. Social networks are redefining the ways we keep in touch. Transport networks give us access to the remotest parts of the world. The energy needed for our domestic and industrial use is supplied by electric power networks. Human survival depends on the functioning of a number of biological and ecological networks.</p><p>In complex networks the ability to function effectively arises not from individual nodes of that network, but from the way they interact. This means a complex network cannot be completely understood by examining each of its parts in isolation, and that the structure and function of such networks are tightly coupled: function is constrained by structure and structure evolves due to function.
