            "description": "Coastline reveals profoundly different perceptions of the liminal space where land meets sea. From contemporary artists Fiona Pardington, Simryn Gill and Daniel Boyd, to renowned Australian painters such as Arthur Streeton, Grace Cossington Smith and Lloyd Rees, the exhibition features artworks from the University Art Collection. \r\n\r\nOver centuries, artists have represented the ocean\u2019s changing appearance and meaning \u2013 sometimes as part of a journey, sometimes as a site of contact, contemplation or pleasure. In Australia, the only nation that is an island continent, the coastline plays a highly symbolic cultural role. Today, with global warming causing rising sea levels and eroding shorelines, the coastline has become a highly charged space demarcating potential zones of conflict and loss. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

Themes of auspicious wishes connect the works across a spectrum of media, including bronze, ceramic, jade, wood, paper and glass. They are appreciated by people in all sectors of Chinese society, and abroad. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

            "description": "Ancient poets had many names for the Mediterranean; none more evocative than Homer\u2019s. The sea\u2019s dangers were disguised by its beauty; its ebb and flow could bring fortune or catastrophe. \r\n\r\nAlthough sailing was treacherous in winter, for the rest of the year the Mediterranean was a highway of traders, colonists and armies. Each traveller brought their own sense of self and community, but the sea's basin was like a mixing bowl (krater) in which cultures and identities were transformed. \r\n\r\nThis exhibition looks at the cultures of the Hellenic world, the Italian peninsula, and their Mediterranean neighbours. Different themes explore the ways in which identity was expressed through the material cultures of the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

They have been translated into many languages for more than 2000 years and continue to echo through contemporary theatre, film and television. \r\n\r\nIn the 1700s taxonomists used names drawn from the myths and legends of the Classical past to name the natural world. \r\n\r\nThis exhibition retells some of these myths \u2013 the ancient Greek epics of the Trojan War and the Odyssey \u2013 through the animal namesakes of the main characters and in the images painted on pottery and sculptured in stone that survive from the ancient past. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

            "description": "The history of Greece is littered across its landscape \u2014 with remnants of ancient temples and medieval castles, and unassuming mounds that mark the sites of historic battles. In the centre of Athens rises the Acropolis, a rocky palimpsest of the past. Whether broken sherds of pottery, or colossal bronze and marble sculptures, artefacts are forever connected to the places from where they came. \r\n\r\nThe impressions of Greece he captured show the beauty of the landscape and the rich layers of history found in ancient monuments, Byzantine churches, Ottoman mosques, and contemporary villages. The people he met, his travel companions, and family and friends all appear in the images, expressing the life, vitality and warm hospitality that Woodhouse encountered on his travels. The photographs reveal his deep love of Greece. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

Different cultures expressed these changes in distinctive ways, developing diverse political and economic systems and religious beliefs. The long-distance exchange of goods such as metals, textiles and semi-precious stones carried new ideas across a highly connected world. \r\n\r\nThe artefacts displayed here represent these cultural innovations. The collection is drawn primarily from Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and the Levant (modern Jordan, Israel/Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and southern Turkey). \r\n\r\nArchaeologists discovered most of these artefacts in the 20th century, as part of excavations operating under a traditional system known as \u2018division\u2019, in which finds were shared between the foreign institutions who excavated them and the countries in which they were found. \r\n\r\nThe University of Sydney acquired artefacts through its own excavations in Cyprus and Jordan, and in recognition of its sponsorship of British digs in historic Palestine, Syria and Iraq. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

            "description": "The broken and incomplete remains of the ancient world are the ghosts of lives lived thousands of years ago. The beautifully carved sculptures, fragile ceramics, and intricate mosaics that adorned Roman homes, temples and streets are now headless figures, hollow-eyed faces, or fragments encrusted with the earth or sea that swallowed them millennia ago. \r\n\r\nIn this exhibition, 2000-year-old marble portraits encircle the headless statue of an unknown Roman man. A columbarium inspired fa\u00e7ade is filled with memorials to faceless people mourned by those they left behind. A detailed model of Pompeii constructed entirely from LEGO explores the ancient city throughout three time periods: life in the ancient city, the history of archaeological discovery at Pompeii and and the pop culture reception of the story of Pompeii. \r\n\r\nFrom names and faces recorded in stone to a contemporary reconstruction of an ancient city, this exhibition reanimates life in the vibrant Roman world. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

He graduated as a doctor in 1905, two decades before becoming a modernist artist in Paris. When his remarkable bequest to the University was announced in 1961, it was accompanied by a gift from his widow, Edith Power, of more than 1000 of his works, from which most of these works are drawn. \r\n \r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

            "description": "Cyprus is the easternmost island in the Mediterranean Sea. Its safe harbours were of strategic importance, providing close connections to the Aegean, Anatolia, the Levantine coast and Egypt. Throughout history, the island has been militarily or economically dominated by Mediterranean superpowers: the Phoenicians, Egyptians, Assyrians, Persians, Ptolemies, Romans, Byzantines, Crusaders, Franks, Venetians, Ottomans and the British. The harbours also served as emporia for international maritime trade routes; for millennia this resource-rich island was exploited for copper, timber, wheat, olives and wine. \r\n\r\nOver the 10,000 years of the island\u2019s human occupation, a rich artistic tradition has been nurtured. The objects displayed here show an island that developed a unique cultural identity, reflecting the civilisations surrounding it, but at the same time distinctively Cypriot. Working in clay, stone, metal and other materials, the makers of these objects not only created artefacts; they made Cyprus one of the cultural powerhouses of antiquity. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

            "description": "Two new exhibitions take you on a journey, through the modern history of Egyptomania and archaeological discovery to the cutting-edge science revealing the lives and afterlives of four unique individuals from the land of the pharaohs. \r\n\r\nAncient Egyptians believed in life after death, but only if their body was preserved in a life-like form. Mummification was a practical response to this spiritual problem. \r\nThe Mummy Room contains the coffins and mummies of four people who lived in Egypt between 1200 BC and 100 AD. Their names are Meruah, Padiashaikhet, Horus and Mer-Neith-it-es and they have much to tell us. CT technology has allowed us to respectfully learn about their daily lives, including nutrition, health and disease. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

            "description": "International trade in the 18th and 19th centuries propelled animal specimens into museums and private collections all over the globe. Early museums gathered curiosities of the natural world in magnificent cabinets, creating displays of strange, monstrous and beautiful animals and minerals. These collections now contribute to our understanding of species, both their form and their geographic distribution. \r\n\r\nNatural Selections showcases some of the most intriguing bird, mammal, fish, insect and invertebrate specimens from the Macleay Collections of natural history, largely collected by members of the Scottish Macleay family who emigrated to Australia from 1826. Featured specimens include a cattle egret acquired from Madagascar well before the species was first seen in Australia, and a magnificent display of Australian cockatoos, illustrating the classificatory systems created by scientists to give order to the enormous number and variety of specimens. \r\n\r\nAs temperatures rise by 1.5 degrees centigrade, animals are facing uncertain futures. Museum collections are providing scientists with critical base information, allowing them to detect shifts in distribution patterns and develop theories on species evolution. These historic collections are critical for understanding how species respond to changing environments.  \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

            "description": "Sarah Goffman: Applied Arts is an immersive deep dive into the interdisciplinary art practice of Sarah Goffman. Intricate and playful, Goffman transforms recycled material, mostly plastic, into artworks that reference larger histories such as the orientalist fascinations of Western collectors. Taking inspiration from the Chau Chak Wing Museum\u2019s collections, Goffman has applied her detailed eye and wit, to turn utilitarian vessels into objet d\u2019art, and paintings into three-dimensional sculpture. By transforming and elevating waste, Goffman\u2019s work prods us to think about consumerism in new and interesting ways. \r\n\r\nSarah Goffman (born 1966) has been exhibiting mixed media installations since 1994. Goffman completed a Diploma of Arts in Photography (1994) and a Bachelor of Fine Arts (2000) at the National Art School. In 2018, she was awarded a Doctor of Creative Arts from the University of Wollongong. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

            "description": "We all know it: the last few days and weeks have been enormously hard for all of us in Sydney and in many other parts of Australia, and for some far harder than for others. \r\n\r\nThe pandemic is ripping at the social fabric of our city, leaving people fearful and impoverished, opening up old divisions and creating new ones. \r\n\r\nIn times like this, it can be hard to think of the future. But even when in the grip of the storm, it is vital to look to the horizon. As soon as the virus is at bay, we will have so much work to do to tackle the inequalities it will leave in its wake. And it is vital that we prepare right now. \r\n\r\nSo who can help navigate us towards the future we will want? Who will be able to lead us? And what role can each of us play in reaching our goal? \r\n\r\nPlease join the Sydney Policy Lab in an urgent online discussion to identify what we can each do to lead the change we want to see after the pandemic. \r\n\r\nOur speakers will include: the University\u2019s new Vice Chancellor, Mark Scott; the Lab\u2019s Director Marc Stears; renowned community organiser and Lab Research lead Amanda Tattersall; CEO of the Paul Ramsay Foundation Glyn Davis; Acting CEO Muslim Women Australia Nemat Kharboutli;  CEO Health Justice Australia, Tessa Boyd-Caine; Chair of Australia\u2019s Mental Health Think Tank, Maree Teesson; and many others. \r\n\r\nWe will also launch the Lab\u2019s new Australian Civic Engagement Index, prepared by Essential Media, which examines how committed Australians are to each other right now, and Marc Stears\u2019 new book, Out of the Ordinary: How Everyday Life Once Inspired a Nation and How It Can Again (Harvard University Press, 2021), which sets out a new agenda and a method for change. \r\n\r\nJoin us to help work out how we can come together to support each other through the pandemic and shape a better future.",

            "description": "In this talk Dr Yahp addresses the challenges of distance and closeness in my research, writing and teaching practices in Malaysia, focussing on research projects undertaken there in recent years, before and after Covid. \r\n\r\nWhat can a writer take from the \u2018closeness\u2019 required of autoethnographic practices of immersion, attentiveness and note-taking and the seemingly paradoxical \u2018distance\u2019 required to tell a larger story? How do we square lived experiences, our own as well as our subjects\u2019, with the \u2018narrative mess\u2019 of life, for example, in pre- and post-Covid Malaysia Baru? In life writing (particularly memoir, personal essays and autobiography), who gets to tell a story, and once told, whose story is it?  She will also consider some creative writing techniques \u2013 visualisation, focalisation \u2013 as possible ways of thinking through these questions and issues.",

Most were unknown in the west until around two centuries ago when European travellers began visiting the country and making records of what they saw. Their archives are an invaluable record of the temples and tombs just as they were being revealed, of a relatively unspoilt landscape that was about to change dramatically, and in some cases of monuments that, paradoxically, have since been lost. \r\n\r\nDr Chris Naunton is an Egyptologist, writer and broadcaster and author of Searching for the Lost Tombs of Egypt (2018), Egyptologists\u2019 Notebooks (2020) and King Tut Tells All! (2021). He has presented numerous television documentaries, including The Man Who Discovered Egypt (BBC4 2012), Ultimate Tut (PBS, 20213), Secrets of King Tut\u2019s Treasures (National Geographic, Disney+ 2018) and Egypt\u2019s Lost Pyramid (Smithsonian Channel, 2019). He was Director (CEO) of the Egypt Exploration Society from 2012 to 2016 and President of the International Association of Egyptologists from 2015 to 2019.",

The region is also powered predominantly by imported fossil fuels and suffers from low electrification rates in many areas, making the transition to renewable energy a policy priority to reduce emissions and promote energy security and resilience. \r\n\r\nA panel of activists and experts will highlight the impacts of fossil fuels on Pacific communities, what opportunities for renewable transition exist as well as the current lack of global environmental regulation in this space. This event seeks to examine how the Pacific region, as a moral and diplomatic leader in addressing climate change, is decarbonising and what role Australia can, and should play, in that process. \r\n\r\nSpeakers \r\n\r\nProfessor Howard Bamsey, Australian National University \r\nGenevieve Jiva, Pacific Climate Warrior \r\nProfessor Susan Park, University of Sydney \r\n\r\nThis event is part of the Unsettling Resources research project that investigates the dependence of our energy use and systems on conventional energy and the global shift to renewables.

Whilst current discourse on the \u201carchive\u201d and the titular role it plays in the visual culture and art history of Southeast Asia as cast from a postcolonial perspective does not preclude female participation, how feminist praxis might have contributed to archival development and practice in the region has yet to be sufficiently explored. \r\n\r\nThis paper is an inaugural study of the power and politics of historical storytelling in two recent but markedly different archives: the Womanifesto archive in collaboration with Asia Art Archive, and the \u2018photo-archives\u2019 that were designed by Indonesian collector, Dr Melani Setiawan. This paper takes stock of women\u2019s invisible labour and the often enterprising and creative work that is expended when keeping records of art and artists, with the aim to ultimately explore the ethos of hospitality that underpins such work.",

This panel from Sydney University's School of Social and Political Science examines the tangle of COVID-19 with the raw materials and production of energy (fossil fuel and green energy) in Australia. The Australian government is promoting a 'gas lead' economic post-COVID recovery, a recovery that depends on opening new fossil fuel extraction projects in areas dedicated to less toxic use of land and water. Simultaneously, private companies are eyeing off Australia's 'green energy' mineral reserves, developing new mines to feed materials to a largely unregulated green energy supply chain. Further along the decarbonisation path communities are adjusting to the transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy production: here our interest turns to ways in which renewable energy projects build and fragment social cohesion and social goods as people adjust also to the social, economic and political fall-out from COVID-19.",

By taking a ca. 1612 painting of the North American turkey\u2014a bird that was introduced in the Indian Ocean world through European ecological imperialism in the Americas\u2014by the Mughal artist Mansur as a point of departure, this talk narrates a history of art that perceives visual representations of the natural world, not merely as a technique to colonise and specimenise nonhuman life forms but as an outcome of interspecies relations that shaped artistic practices in the early modern period.

Chinese ceramics carried by these vessels date their demise to the 14th and 18th centuries \u2013 pivotal moments in the global China Trade. Notably, the older wreck yielded the largest cargo of Yuan-dynasty blue-and-white porcelain discovered to date, potentially transforming current scholarly paradigms derived from Dr Flecker\u2019s own previous salvage operations. In contrast to a prevailing emphasis on exchange between China, West Asia, and Europe, this cargo sheds light on the pivotal role played by Southeast Asian merchants and consumers. The taste for Chinese ceramics in the Islamic states of the Malay Peninsula, for example, for which this cargo may have been intended, closely mirrors that of their counterparts in West Asia. The esteem reserved for the same ceramics in Vietnam, on the other hand, reflects a parallel sphere of trade largely overlooked in canonical narratives.

            "description": "Light & Darkness is a major exhibition drawing on the University of Sydney\u2019s Power Collection. It spans the luminal, op and kinetic works of the 1960s by major artists such as Jean Tinguely and Bridget Riley; the political and conceptual art of the 1970s with Ed Kienholtz, Joseph Beuys and On Kawara; and Australian and New Zealander artists in the 1980s, including Peter Tyndall, Jenny Watson and Colin McCahon. The exhibition and accompanying book are the first projects from the University\u2019s extensive collection of international contemporary art in its new home at the Chau Chak Wing Museum. \r\n\r\n\u2018Light works\u2019 are a major feature of the early Power acquisitions in the late 1960s. Significantly, a planetary grammar of solar discs, spheres and orbs is a common vocabulary for many artists who employ light, whether literally or in abstraction. Other kinetic works, such as those by Julio Le Parc and Lucio Fontana, have a lightness, moving according to air currents. As the utopian dreams of the 1960s soured, many artists turned to language; the darker side of the collection features major text paintings by New Zealanders McCahon and Maori artist Ralph Hotere, alongside a multiple by Kienholtz who spotlights a horrific race crime, and Beuys who is represented by \u2018a hair shirt masquerading as a felt suit\u2019. Today the Power Collection, spanning 25 years, appears like a time-capsule. \r\n\r\nWeekdays: 10am - 5pm (Thursday late night closing at 9pm)\r\nWeekends: 12pm - 4pm",

            "description": "Objects occupy a space in the slipstream of time. They can act as a mnemonic portal into our past, both light and dark, and their story can be rewritten for new futures to emerge. In a museum they wait, with embodied energies of wisdom, trauma and intrigue. But behind glass and walls, and in the absence of human connection, what continues to remain untold? \r\n\r\nIn renewing the spirit and animating the object, the colonial powers that collected them can be decentred, and the voiceless heard and brought back into being. In this lecture Kimberley will share her practice: an evolving curatorial methodology that is centred on the transformative power of First Peoples contemporary artists engaging with museum collections.

With humanity, complexity and genuine insight, Heroes of the Fourth Turning excavates the schism between old-guard conservatives and new Trumpist identity politics. \r\n\r\nIt's nearing midnight in Wyoming, where four young conservatives have gathered at a backyard after-party. They've returned home to celebrate their mentor, Gina, newly inducted as president of a tiny Catholic college. But as their reunion spirals into spiritual chaos and clashing generational politics, it becomes less a celebration than a desperate fight to be understood. \r\n\r\nOn a chilly night in the middle of America, Will Arbery's haunting play offers grace and clarity, speaking to the heart of a country at war with itself. \r\n\r\n7:30pm - 9:45pm, plus 2pm - 4:15pm matinee on Saturdays\r\nFor a full list of dates, please click the 'More information / Registration' button below. \r\n\r\nFull $49 \r\nPreview $33 \r\nSenior, Group 8+ $39 \r\nPensioner, Veteran, Full-time Student $35 \r\nUnder 35 $35 \r\n\r\nPlus $6 transaction fee applies",

These crises have unsettled established political and economic relations and, for labour movements, given rise to urgent demands for the protection of the health, income and employment security of workers and their democratic rights both in and beyond the workplace. For some movements the crises also are a moment to envisage alternative social and economic models and a required transformation to a more equitable and low carbon economy. \r\n\r\nThis Asia-Pacific Conference of the International Sociological Association\u2019s Research Committee on Labour Movements (RC44) provides an opportunity for scholars, based both within and outside the region, to consider the agency and potential of workers and their labour movements to shape and make a post COVID-19 world.  \r\n\r\nCall for Papers open until 15 November 2021",
