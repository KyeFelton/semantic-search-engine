## usydKnowledge: a knowledge graph for the University of Sydney

usydKnowledge is a Python program designed to extract and model information about the University of Sydney from the Web. Built on top of [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), the program follows a customised, modular framework that enables extensions to be implemented with relative ease.

Before starting the program, a valid instance of Stardog's [Enterprise Knowledge Graph](https://www.stardog.com/) platform must be running and configured in config.py.
