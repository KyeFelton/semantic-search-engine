# USYD Search Engine

Many users rely on search engines to retrieve information. However, despite their importance, the University of Sydneyâ€™s site search engine leaves much to be desired. Motivated by developments in the fields of semantic search, this project aims to create a semantic search engine that exploits a knowledge graph for information retrieval.

The project is currently in progress and expected to be completed by November 2021.
